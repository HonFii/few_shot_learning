I have been using Energizer NiMh batteries for years.  I recently purchased these because they have a higher power rating (2500mAh) as opposed to my older batteries (1800mAh). I primarily use the AA batteries to power wireless controllers for video game consoles.  Their performance varies depending on the controller I use them in, but overall it beats buying regular batteries.  Using them also reduces consumption and helps keep regular batteries out of landfills.I recommend charging and using them immediately.  I have found, if you charge them, and let them sit for as little as a week, they will lose part of their charge. I have a large Energizer charging base that charges all sizes, not just AA batteries, but I leave a set of these in the charger all the time, so they are fully-charged when I need them.  Keep an extra set for a complete swap, because they could take at least 4 hours to charge completely.  If you need 2, buy 4.  If you need 4, buy 8, and so forth.On average, in terms of hours, they last about 75% as long as regular batteries, so I cannot complain about their performance at all.  If you don't use them in about 3-4 weeks, however, they will need to be recharged.
I always buy this brand of batteries. I have not used one yet, but I think they will be okay.
The name "Maglite" has always been, to me synonymous with quality -- I've been wearing this one on my belt for several years now. It's small, light-weight and has a powerful light for something this small. The beam is quite bright for a flashlight this size, and the "candle" mode is a nifty feature (especially when the end of the flashlight fits into the upended top).It helped me more than once, especially when in a crowded elevator during a minor power outage. My parting comment to all who were in this elevator with me - "Why didn't YOU have a flashlight with you?"My ONLY gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath, which is durable -- not only allows the flashlight to fall out in some situations, but it does not keep the rotating head of the flashlight protected. More than once someone has come up to me to say "Umm.... your BELT is all lit up!!"  I solved that problem by sewing a (rip-stopped) strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath (back to front), and attaching velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath, so now my maglite stays securely in the sheath.Would I buy aother Maglite? Sure! I'd like to eventually buy the whole family of Maglites -- from tiny to huge. They do the job and do it well.
This little light is bright but right in the center seems to be a dark area? It loses a star for the dark center, you would think the center would be the brightest but it isn't.
I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine, and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts, and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse, adjusting equipment, finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday, all-the-time uses, the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE, which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity, utility, and durability.
These work very well.  They aren't as green as rechargeable, but these do last longer than regular batteries.  Highly recommended.
There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do, especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch, without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run, but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger, I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries, I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+
The Energizer L92 Lithium AAA cell is a fantastic power source. For high-drain applications, it offers great advantages over ordinary alkaline cell and rechargeable NiMH cell. However, it is also very expensive as a disposable battery. So it is important to recognize the strength of L92, and use it only in applications that give you the best results. Otherwise you'll be wasting your money.According to data sheet published by Energizer, the capacity of this Lithium AAA cell (L92) is 1200mAh. This number remains nearly constant with load current. In comparison, the ordinary Alkaline battery (such as the Energizer E92) is also rated as 1200mAh, but only at a very light load of 25mA. At a heavy load of 500mA (typical for a P&S; digital camera), its capacity is reduced to about one-third. The difference gets even greater at low temperature. At zero degree C and 500mA load, the L92 can provide about seven times more energy compared to the E92. This is where the marketing claim of "Last up to 7 times longer" comes from.When used in a digital camera at room temperature of 25 degree C, the L92 is more likely to last 3-4 times longer than alkaline. This is enough to justify its price, which is also around 3-4 times higher than alkaline. However, in low-drain applications (such as smoke detector, wireless mouse or remote control) alkaline cells will last just as long at a fraction of the cost.The L92 also contains much higher energy when compared to rechargeable NiMH cell such as theSanyo Eneloop AAA. This is partially due to its higher terminal voltage of 1.5V, which is 20% higher than that for NiMH.Energy stored in eneloop AAA: 0.8Ah * 1.25V = 1.0Wh,Energy stored in L92 : 1.2Ah * 1.5V = 1.8Wh (80% higher).Higher terminal voltage for L92 is especially advantageous in digital camera applications, because your camera flash will recharge up to 20% faster. On the other hand, it may create problems with some applications such as unregulated LED flash light. Higher than expected voltage will make the lamp burn brighter, but the excessive heat may also cause the lamp to burn out quickly.Bottom line: If you need AAA batteries for a long hiking trip or for emergency standby, then L92 is obviously your best choice. For most other situations, I recommend using low self-discharge NiMH cells for lower operating cost.
The Energizer Lithium AA battery 8-packs are great value.  I discovered these batteries as they came with my Apple wireless keyboard and mouse.  I was incredibly impressed by the longevity of those particular wireless devices, when powered by these lithium batteries.  I went several months without thinking about batteries in them.  By comparison, afterwards, I used traditional alkaline AAs and the same devices lasted only a few short weeks.Now I am again enjoying the benefits of these lithium batteries.  This 8-pack sold on Amazon is a particularly great value. At first I thought the lithium batteries were too expensive, when I saw a 2-pack in a store, for nearly ten dollars.  With this package on Amazon, the batteries usually cost around two dollars each.  A great value and not much more than alkaline batteries, for a lot longer lasting power!Lithium batteries also work better in extreme temperatures.  If you, for example, have an outside thermostat for a weather station, this will work in the winter, whereas an alkaline battery may not.An interesting tip, when my higher power devices, like bluetooth keyboard, runs low on power.  I go ahead and pop one of the used lithium batteries into a clock.  I'm not sure how long it will last, but it's a great way to recycle at least a few of your almost drained lithium batteries.Now I've started using these, new,  in powered toothbrushes, and I find it's a lot more powerful and longer lasting.I highly recommended these for devices that quickly drain regular alkaline varieties.
I like this brush, though I do wish it had a suction cup, or something, so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job, though, even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand, and while it was nice, the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary.
I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle, Gray, 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them, but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them, so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made, cleans thoroughly, and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints.
I'm a fan of OXO products and this one is no different. Well made and designed. The grip feels nice and has grooves, the shaft is slightly flexible and the brush is the correct size for what I needed. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the bristles should be a bit stiffer, otherwise it's perfect.
Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me, it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the "on" button after shaving and walking away, knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel, I don't bring the cleaning unit, so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day, which (a) takes a few minutes, and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars, withholding one star just for the price.
I've used Braun shavers for donkey's years ever since I got one for Christmas years ago. I won't ever go back to a blade even if it does shave more closely, I just can't stand to think that I'm just a sneeze away from a free face peel.Before Braun came up with this cash cow I was cleaning my Braun with a toothbrush every 2-3 shaves. I still do that about once a month because even though the fluid cleans the cutting blade you still get hair detritus left behind in cracks, outside of the foil assembly and even around the two screws under the cutting block and other places. So once in a while, I'll get out my trusty toothbrush again and give the whole shaver a thorough cleaning over.This fluid is not cheap so I try to prolong the life span of it by "pre-cleaning" my shaver. I always open up the shaver and tap away the loose hair cuttings after every shave. This way, the cleaner fluid stays cleaner longer. And everyone is right, I don't think there's any way of preventing the fluid from evaporating, LOL, I think Braun made sure of that. Just make sure you don't park your cleaner in a hot area.Taking the advice of some the other reviewers, when I'm done with the cleaning, I remove the cleaning fluid and cap it to prevent further evaporation. The instructions say the fluid should normally last 1 month. By removing the cleaning fluid and capping it, I'm able to have it last 6 weeks even with cleaning the shaver after every use. But I would not recommend using it longer than that because dead bacteria and other things I'd rather not think about is going to remain in the cleaner fluid reservoir, and the cleaner fluid gets more concentrated and dirty. As another reviewer says, it's about $5 per month, which is not bad to have your shaver smelling good and clean. And it's certainly good for Braun!
I have this razor, and love it and the cleaning system. But does Amazon take us for fools? They are selling this three-pack for more per unit ($4.33 per) than the two-pack ($3.99 per). Hopefully they'll lower this price instead of raising the other one...
I bought these for my friend, who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days, I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials), so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit, and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend, at least ;)
I've always had a bit of an issue with PowerBars:  they look like someone has poured a chewed granola bar into a packet and sealed it up.  If the unopened bar even gets slightly warm, it warps all out of shape.  So when you open the pack, you get this weirdly shaped bar of stuff.  Even so, this new Fruit Smoothie bar, while not overly attractive looking, tastes pretty much like a fruit smoothie surprisingly enough.  PowerBar did a good job of hiding that usual "protein bar" taste with these.  The texture is a little strange and the calories are a little high, but if you can get over the weird sensation your tongue will get and use the bar as a meal replacement, then these bars a pretty dang good.
This bar tastes a lot like a smoothie in bar form.  Very fruity, quite sweet.  It remains to be seen if the bar delivers the physiological benefits the package describes, but it certainly tastes good.
I think most energy bars taste pretty bad, but this one actually has a pleasant fruit flavor, and a consistency like a thick fruit rollup.  With 42g of carbs this bar should really get you going.  I use Clif Builders protein bars as a meal replacement, and like them a lot.  I don't think this particular bar would work as a meal replacement, but instead as a supplement before a workout or other physical activity.If you already eat Power Bars, but haven't tried this specific flavor, you should give it a shot.  If you aren't really into energy bars, and are thinking of trying one, I think this is one that has decent enough flavor that it won't turn you off.
If you like nutrition bars, these are a good choice. Packed with all sorts of goodness they fit the bill and taste good too. The only thing I think needs some warning is it can be very chewy and might dislodge a filling. They have a taffy consistency and as such may play havoc with your teeth. That said they are tasty and chewy can be good as it makes it last a long time. Enjoy!
I'm an energy and health bar fan who prefers granola and Kashi bars rather than "sweet" and "fruity" yet this product surprised me with its flavor plus. If you like a "sweet" yet healthy snack or meal replacement you might consider this product. It does not have a strong overpowering fruit flavor but it does have a blast of berry taste. The consistancy is like taffy and it is best when "pulled" apart than just biting into it as it will stick to your teeth a bit. The carbs and sugar grams are a little higher than I would like and the fiber a bit non-existant but overall the vitamins and minerals are quite sufficient even though it does not contain any Vitamin A and very low potassium with only 35mg. The calories are 210 a bar which is average for a power bar and slightly less than a candy bar. Great for a quick breakfast on the run or a snack in between.
I like that this product has "no artificial flavors, colors, sweetners or high fructose corn syrup". It had the texture of taffy, rather than the unpleasant mealy feel that so many granola type bars have. It was sweet but not too sweet. It tasted like berries, as advertised, unlike so many of the energy bars out there. Nothing to write home about, but better than a lot of the similar bars out there. I will probably try a different flavor next time.
NO REAL FLAW,JUST COULD SELL A BIT CHEAPER.THOUGH IT IS ACTUALLY MEDIUM PRICED COMPARED TO IT'S COMPETITORS. IT JUST DOES NOT GET ANY MORE CONVENIENT ,TASTES AS GOOD AS MOST CANDY BARS ,YET IS GUILT-FREE AS FAR AS ACTUALLY BEING NUTRITIOUS AND LESS CALORIC! AGAIN TAKE IT ALONG FOR ALL OF THE SPORTS FUCTIONS,YOUR FAMILY IS INVOLVED IN OR SERVE IT UP ANYTIME ,ANYWHERE AS A SNACK!
I thought this had a great taste and texture. Only thing is it tasted almost like candy to me and it made me want more.  Which is great if you aren't watching your weight, but I am.I would definitely buy this if I saw it in the store and we were going hiking and I knew I was going to work it off.
I really enjoyed this bar. It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed.  The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all.  Infact, I barely noticed it.  The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy.  I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat.  I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water.This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone.
I'm unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don't want it to.  So I needed a trimmer, and one that could handle the ears and nose.  This little guy works great.  I doesn't pull and gets in pretty close.  My only complaint is that the vibrations from the head tickle the heck out of my nose.  But all in all, a good choice.
I needed to get some extra brushes for myOral-b 3000 Professional Care 3000 Electric Toothbrushso after looking at them in store and getting sticker shock I decided to check out Amazon.  I was happy to find them here for 50% less and on Subscribe & Save too.  Not much I can say other than they work as expected and they are the sensitive extra-soft head which is my preference.  I will continue to purchase them here on Amazon as long as they are competitive in their pricing.
If I buy something--lipstick, sunglasses, favorite drink, energy bar--whatever, it's sure to go out of stock.  I seem to be on the end of the curve.  I have sensitive teeth (as do many of us of a certain age), and I find I'm not as thorough in brushing as I need to be.  I bought the tooth brush years ago for a very reasonable price (like $20).  But the brushes? Not so reasonable.  Then I couldn't get them at all.  Turn to good old Amazon and there you are! These are just what I needed, and I'll be ordering them again, assuming I don't wear out the brush base itself.
The extra soft is much more gentle than the standard soft.  Noticeable difference, particularly if you have sensitive teethThey wear fairly well though not quite as long as the regular soft brushes.  This is probably because with electric toothbrushes you don't use as much pressure on your teeth.Another option to get them inexpensively is to use a 20% off coupons at Bed Bath and Beyond which carries all the Oral B heads
Short summary - these work very well for cleaning teeth, but I recommend the Sensitive Clean heads that work as well and have a lower risk of gum damage.  If you have no issues with gum loss and prefer a "medium" bristle, then these are an excellent choice.I've been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for several years.  I've used the Pro White (one pack), Floss Action (one pack), Precision Clean (these), and Sensitive Clean (for years) brush heads.  Because of earlier gum loss, I've been using the Sensitive Clean heads for the vast majority of the time.  The Pro White and Floss Action were uncomfortable for me to use, as they felt too abrasive on my gums.  The Sensitive Clean are by far the most gentle and don't cause any discomfort, and these Precision Clean heads are pretty comfortable with only an occasional amount of small discomfort on my gums.I'd say that these are equivalent to a "medium" bristle in a manual brush, while the Sensitive Clean heads are a "soft" to "extra soft" bristle.  Studies indicate, and (I just saw while writing this) Oral-B's own website states this, that firmer bristles do not clean teeth any better than soft bristles but that they can cause more cervical abrasion on the gums.  It's not the type of bristle, but rather the type of brushing, that makes a brush effective.  The beauty of the electric toothbrush is that it makes brushing properly far easier, so soft bristles can be very effective.  Since I started using an Oral-B electric toothbrush with the Sensitive Clean heads, my dental hygienist spends most of the time just talking to me as there's not much for her to clean.I give these four stars because they are a high-quality product like the other Oral-B brush heads, and because they are overall pretty comfortable to use.  I do "like" them, but I don't "love" them because they aren't as comfortable to me as the Sensitive Clean heads.
I like these replacement brush heads.  They do a good job, and fit perfectlyOral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.This is a type of the brush head that you use to brush each tooth separately.  The small size allows for easy reach to teeth in the back of the mouth.  However, my preferred Oral B brush head isOral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.).
My wife and I both have a Oral-B, the replacement brushes seem a bit pricey.  I bought a pack of generic brushes that were really cheap compared to these.  After using I found they did not last nearly as long and the bristles were just not up to snuff compared to the genuine brushes.  Have used the Oral-B with the small cup in the center of the bristles thinking that would retain the toothpaste on the brush a bit longer, I like those also.Anyway, I am back to these and think they just can't be beat.  I would recommend these over any other replacement brushes, and considering how much longer they last probably the best buy. Sometimes the "cheap" ends up actually costing more. These are a quality product as is the whole Oral-B electric toothbrush.
Just like old friends toothbrush heads come and go. Finding a quality head that can go the distance and aid in providing proper dental hygiene is a must. Even though Amazon promotes this particular line up as a new product, this head has been around for quite some time. The only thing that has changed is the packaging and re-branding. As a long time user of Oral B power tooth brushes, these heads do the job quite nicely.I found these Oral B Professional Eb20 brush heads very durable and last at least twice as long as the competitors. For me, this dental tool penetrates much better and leaves my teeth feeling clean. Even though my dentist recommends changing brush heads monthly, I can easily get three months out of each brush. That was never the case on my old Sonic system. Power brush users should keep in mind that its not one size fits all. This product will not fit on any of the Arm & Hammer, Colgate, OptiClean, Sonic or WaterPik brands.My only negative is the price. Hard plastic and bristles should not cost this much. Still, I'd recommend this product again.
I've used several Oral-B toothbrush heads and these are my second favorite. The Precision Clean heads give your teeth a deep cleaning, but those with sensitive teeth might find them a little uncomfortable. Compared to the Floss Action heads, these have a distinctly firmer feel but are more durable. For my preferences, the Precision Clean trumps the Floss Action. Those that want a bigger and more traditional toothbrush shape should opt for the Dual Clean heads. They don't have the "dentist tool" feel, but instead are shaped like a traditional toothbrush heads. As for the Pro White heads, I didn't like the feel at all and don't believe the rubber nob helps with whitening.Of course your personal preferences mean everything. As for mine I would rank the various heads like this:1) Dual Clean -- Traditional shape, allows for more toothpaste, two types of cleaning action2) Precision Clean -- Firm feel, durable heads3) Floss Action -- More sensitive feel, but also less durable4) Pro White -- Harshest feel of the four, polishing effect is dubiousDepending on what characteristics you're looking for, the Precision Clean heads could be what you're looking for. They're very good, offering a strong combination of cleaning ability and durability, but with a slightly firmer feel than the Floss Action heads.
Hard to say I love my toothbrush, but these do work well in my Oral-B handle. It has been working for a long time and was recommended by our dentist.
Oral-B electric toothbrushes are the best on the market. Their brush heads are well-made and last a long time. However, I prefer the floss-action heads to these -- not because they replace flossing (they don't) but because they're bigger and so seem to clean a bit more thoroughly.
I've been using Oral-B brush heads for many years but have never tried this version. It works fine for me but is a bit tougher on the teeth then the ones I have used in the past. It tends to cause more of a beating on the teeth due to the design of the bristles, some long and some short, instead of all one length. The mechanics work well. My biggest concern is the price. It's five times more expensive then the generics. So many reviewers had problems with the generics that I decided to spend the ridiculous price for the Oral-B originals. Hope it was worth it.
Basic brush head, medium-soft, simple and gets the job done. Be sure to use Subscribe & Save for the best value.
My Sonicare still works nicely after several years, and I needed replacement heads. These new ones do not seem as rugid to me as the original ones, and they are expensive at nearly $11.00 each, especially if replacing one every 3-6 months.
I have an elite model that is over 4 years old. Guess they redesigned these. The original felt aa little stiffer when new & softened over time. These change color to tell you when to replace them. I just do it after every 6 month check up with my dental hygenist. They fit fine, work fine, feel fine. Not much more to say about them.
The prices are marked to kill someone's wallet, but they work like a charm.I noticed on the very second night the need to keep going decrease. And ditto, with my roommate since I decided to split the gels.
Like most sups, it is sometimes difficult to tell what the sup is doing. This sup appears to have a good make-up of ingredients, but for me I didn't really notice any difference while taking it vs. not taking it. As I didn't have an issue to be "treated" by the sup that wasn't a suprise to me. Kind of took it as a preventive, like I would take fish oil or a vitamin. These are sups that also don't yield a noticeable result but I am hoping will offer long term benefits instead that aren't seen during the course of one bottle. In taking this prostrate sup you will have to make that call for yourself. This sup should be taken with food as it will cause a bit of heartburn if taken alone.
OK, I'm not sure what to say about this product. I'm glad that I have the chance to take it and it seems like an important mix of herbs to take for prostate health. I can't say that I've noticed any change in my urination since taking this, but if it's keeping my prostate healthy, then I'm glad for the product! What I can say about this is that the pills are small and easy to swallow and I don't taste them at all after taking them. (no burping issues, etc). The pills are a deep, dark color so they are easy to identify. I take many supplements and medications and I'm glad that I don't have to think which ones are my prostate pills. I hope they help!
I am 55 years old and have developed some prostate issues such as a slow stream and needing to go on a moments notice. Since I was familiar with New Chapter's other products, such as their multi-vitamins, I thought I would give the Prostate 5lx a try.  I like the fact that their product are made of organic ingredients and going to their website I was convinced that their hearts were really in to making their products. So does it work? Yes! After a month I noticed increased flow. I still have the frequency issues, though. I found that it is important to follow the directions and take with a large meal because when I didn't I got a bit of an upset stomach, unlike their vitamins which can be taken anytime. I have tried other products such as plain saw palmetto and did not have the same results. I also began drinking more plain water and cut back on coffee. I have a friend who did not have the same results that I did so it's effectiveness may depend on the individual. I recommend the product, along with a good low salt, low fat diet and plenty of water.
I started taking this product a few weeks ago and so far it seems to work just fine. I don't experience any of the symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate but the real proof is in the results of a physical. I've got a physical scheduled in a month or so and will report back on the results, being clear but not graphic.
I have been taking a saw palmetto supplement for years after suffering from protatitis and a enlarged prostate (benign prostate hyperplasia)diagnosis. Consumer Reports has stated that saw palmetto seems to have some beneficial affect on managing prostate health. What I can report is while my prostate is still larger than normal, my PSA (prostate specific antigen) count has remained in the normal range, suggesting there is no evidence of prostate cancer. I had an untrasound image of my prostate taken last year showing no cancerous growths. So, does saw palmetto work?... It doesn't seem to hurt.Prostate 5LX contains a substantial dose of saw palmetto plus green tea extracts which NewChapter says modulates inflamation, and has anti-aging properties. These capsules also contain stinging nettle extracts, ginger, selenium, rosemary and pumpkin seed oil, all of which are supposed to contribute to prostate health.I have just started taking Prostate 5LX, so I can't state what affect is has yet. I will update this report after 30 days.Update. After 30 days, I didn't notice any results. I still think my prostate can use some help, but there are much less exprensive supplements that contain the same active ingedients. I have swithched to TruNatre Prostate Health Complex (250 day supply for less than $21). Less than 10 cents per day is cheap insurance.
New Chapter has a very good reputation for making high quality products.  Unlike many other brands, New Chapter makes supplements that are closer to natural food than synthetic supplements.Prostate 5LX softgels are nicely sized and very easy to swallow.This is primarily a "Saw Palmetto" product supported by many other nutrients. This product is a nice formulation of Selenium, Saw Palmetto, Green Tea, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Ginger, Stinging Nettle and Rosemary.Saw Palmetto helps regulate hormones, it can help avoid conversion of testosterone to estradiol.  Don't take more than two of these softgels per day as excessive saw palmetto can lead to reduced libido.Clinical studies (with humans) have demonstrated that ingestion of pumpkin seed extract can improve the structural support of the bladder and the function of the sphincter muscle.Rosemary enhances vitamin D's anti-cancer activity, so inclusion in this product may help prevent prostate cancer.Don't expect miracles, but this good natural product should help maintain prostate health.  Plan two months or longer before expecting to notice any benefits.
If you take "drug store" saw palmetto you have probably wondered about the stronger cocktail like concentration products.  If you listen to satellite talk radio programs you've probably heard one in particular advertised as free.  As we all know it's really just trying to get you to subscribe to that company's regular home delivered services.  If you like the product and continue with the delivery it is anything but free in the long run...And to my way of thinking if you subscribe to the supposed benefits you will want long-term use.That said I cannot verify this is even a superior product to commonly available alternatives.  What I will say is it is about the most complete at the price I've seen.  It may be better than the simplier saw palmetto supplement I have taken, yet I cannot verify that either.  It seems to be every bit as good and I am thinking it is, in fact, better.  That said, at the price you can purchase this at through Amazon it is recommended if this is something you would use anyway.  Like I've said, it is one of the more complete and concentrated supplements of it's kind and as such represents a value.
My father has prostate issues, so I've tried to keep mine as healthy as possible. From my research over the years, I found Saw Palmetto to be the one non-prescription supplement everyone keeps coming back to. For a healthy prostate, prevention pays and the earlier you start supplementing the better. My father, who has an enlarged prostate, has used this formula after the fact and experienced noticeable beneficial effects.I've taken most of one bottle as of writing this and while I can't say I notice much difference, I'm having no problems and feeling pretty healthy down there. The manufacturer claims that the ingredients in this product work synergistically and provide a greater benefit than any one of them alone. This may be, and the purity of the extracts seems quite good and well documented. Not only that -- the ingredients make for a good all-purpose male antioxidant blend as well.  The ginger has even helped quiet my occasional growling stomach.The only real way to know if this product will work for you is to try it out yourself.  Everyone's body chemistry is different. It may be on the pricey side, but I would recommend that any man looking for prostate problem relief give New Chapter's 5LX a shot before trying other (perhaps lesser) products out there. [...]
It is very hard to review nutritional supplements, vitamins, etc. as the perceived result/effect can be skewed by a number of things.I ordered these for my husband who has used at least three other brands of this type of prostate protection/support supplement.  The more expensive and supposedly more beneficial product will have a blend of not only saw palmetto but also pumpkin seed oil and stinging nettle and usually pygeum bark extract.  This NewChapter version does not contain the pygeum but adds green tea, pumpkin seed oil, ginger, stinging nettle extracts and rosemary to the saw palmetto extract, and is hexane free.The price here on Amazon for the 120 count softgel is pretty good, better than 'vitacost' which surprises me because they are usually lower on supplement products.Overall my husband has had much improvement in urinary function since adding the saw palmetto supplements to his diet years ago, but as far as brand-by-brand comparison goes, he does not see a difference.
Having an enlarged prostate most definitely isn't fun and I'm skeptical of most OTC meds, but this one appears to have helped with urinary problems (the flow and stream are more pronounced).Unfortunately, having just this number of pills won't tell me anything in the long run but I'll see what becomes of the experiment over time.
As you can see, I am part of the Vine program, and we are given an opportunity to choose a product or so each month.  This time I chose this Prostate 5LX formula.  However, what I did not think about is how on earth would I review it.  I could have waited longer, but was only given a 30 day supply, so here it is.I have been takingNature's Bounty Saw Palmetto, 160 mg, 60 Softgelsfor a few years.  I stuck with that brand because it goes on sale periodically, and typically the best price.  But even after years of taking it, I have no idea if it's doing anything.  All I can say is that I am 42, and have no problems below, so far.The difference in price between these two is really not much (based on list price, not third party lure prices), the reason is the dosage.  I typically take 160mg per day of the standard Saw Palmetto. However, the 5LX formula suggested dose includes 320mg.  Albeit, they say take two tablets, so I actually could have stuck with the 160mg dose by taking one.  The biggest difference are the added ingredients being green tea, ginger, rosemary, pumpkin seed oil and stinging nettle ... whatever all that stuff is.  But most of us by now have bought into the benefits of green tea.  It's the combination of the other ingredients that promote better flow and inflammation reduction.Since I have not had any prostate or related issues, the review factor is tough, as I mentioned.  However, I am interested in knowing if there is an unspoken virility factor here.  Trying to be sensitive as possible with the description of my result, I have to admit there is a lot going on down there in a good way.  Let's face it, most guys last about one round in the bedroom with the occasional second time soon after.  But what I noticed (not even thinking about the product) is that I have never been so repeatedly in double-round mode.  And I can't even remember the last time I made it to round three since my teen years, and well, it's happened a few times.  Now I actually have no idea if this has anything to do with this supplement, but I have no other reason to associate it to.  It's important to note that I am not claiming this is an erectile disfunction aid, but only a guy would know the feeling of the need to "release", and I guess that is what I feel.  Like I am not done yet, when I just finished.... ok... I'm officially embarrassed now.  But, there you go.I deduct a star for packaging and price.  List price for 60 gels is $30 and 120 is $50. But as you can see, it could go on sale etc.  Obviously the 120 bottle is a better deal.  But something that annoys me is that the bottle is glass and in a cardboard box.  The bottle is not really reusable for anything, so, it gets recycled.  It just seems irresponsible based on the fact that if it were in a plastic bottle, you would not need a box, and it would weigh less, meaning less energy used to move it, etc.  I'm not a green freak, but, c'mon.I was expecting nothing with this, and was sure I would be doing a 3 star review, not being able to say much.  But it's fairly close to a 5.  I like the fact that the dose is a choice, and 60 softgels could last 60 days if you wish.  But I did 2 a day, and after this experience, I guess I am getting more soon and upgrading my prostate health regimen... yeah.  That's it... I'm doing it for prostate health.  Not the other thing.  Or am I?  It's a win/win for me.
The product description of "New Chapter Prostate 5lx" provides excellent detail of the ingredients and intended use, so I won't repeat. However, I will say that New Chapter is a highly respected name in the naturopathic industry [according to my friend who works in the field], and that everything in this product is apparently safe [try saying that about pharmaceuticals!]. Also, the empirical evidence available publicly indicates that there is at least a some basis for the claimed efficacy of this product. I, myself, am not a medical professional, so I can only comment on what I have read.The gel caps are very easy to take, and they come in a nice brown glass bottle...in a day when many things come in plastic. They recommend taking the caps when eating a meal, which is a good idea.Some reviewers appear to have misinterpreted the purpose of this product...my understanding is that it is primarily a preventative & maintenance product, and not intended to resolve current acute afflictions. The product description is very helpful.One should always consult a professional!
I love this mop! It is easy to use and very convenient. The replacements are expensive but I refill with my own solution to save money. The mop pads aren't as good as the older ones but it gets the job done and it works for me so I will continue to use this mop.
I've been going nuts trying to find a happy medium between getting down on my knees and scrubbing my floor, and using a mop which doesn't seem to accomplish too much beyond moving progressively dirtier water around the floor.  I think the Swiffer might be the answer, but only with modifications.  Let me start with lists, I love lists:Pros:  Eliminates the need for a bucket of filthy water, sprays just as much cleaning solution as you want, pad sucks up dirty solution and holds it, pad also holds on to dirt, and is disposable.Cons:  Cleaning solution REEKS.  Seriously it just stinks.  (Why do they make these things so perfume-y?) Possibility that solution is toxic to animals, and by extension could be equally toxic to small humans.  (There are arguments on both sides.) Does leave streaks, particularly on wood.  "Scrubber" strip is not only difficult to use it's not very good at its job.  Proprietary design makes using any other product with the Swiffer impossible.Or does it?  Because the cleaning solution smelled so horrible to me -- and granted I'm hyper-sensitive to synthetic scents, but even my housemate said "What is that SMELL?" -- I went looking for a solution solution.  And of course the internet, source of all wisdom, provided an answer.  You actually can get the cap off the solution bottle if you warm it under hot water, and use a pair of pliers to twist it off.  Then you can replace their solution with your own.  This has the added advantage of saving a chunk of change.So, armed with a newly charged bottle of Dargie's Homemade Swiffer Juice, I rewashed the floor I'd done the night before and let me tell you the results were shocking.  I didn't even spend as much time over the job as I had last night, and still the pad came away black with dirt!  For all its vaunted dirt dissolving, the Swiffer cleaning solution appears not to be very good at getting all the dirt up.  So this morning my floors are substantially cleaner, the house smells better, and I am no longer worried about the cats ingesting any stray chemicals.I will say that you do have to get up as much loose dirt and dust as you can before you mop, but that's essentially true of any mop.  But I can also tell you that unless you seriously over-do the spraying, your floors will dry quickly, which means there's less chance of slipping on a stubbornly wet bit, or leaving footprints.Some people don't like the fact that the pads are disposable, and I get that.  Apparently you can make your own pads out of microfiber.  I reserve judgment on that at this point because I find that these pads are constructed to handle a whole lot of dirt and liquid, and I'm not sure I believe that microfiber will do the same.The bottom line is that I do recommend this product, but I also recommend that you give some thought to modifying it if it doesn't suit you.  In spite of attempts to make all of this proprietary, you can hack your Swiffer pretty easily.
I bought these because they were on sale.  I always use coppertops so this was a new &#34;brand&#34; for me.I went to the Duracell website to check the differences between these batteries, and it appears that their stats are the same.Maybe I am imaging it, but my Duracell lasted longer.  However, I cannot prove it, and I didn't do a test.  All I know is the last couple times I had to change batteries, they were the Procells.  That leads me to believe none of my Duracell batteries died, and those were all put in before I had any Procells.Good luck!!
These batteries are a very good choice for an inexpensive alkaline. Heavy duty batteries, are not cost effective because although cheaper, they have a very short run time. To get the best bang for your buck, go for alkalines like these.The "Procell" designation is basically Duracell's way of marking these batteries as ones intended for industrial applications. They make them as a separate line so they won't directly compete with their consumer lines.My experience is that these batteries do not last quite as long as the top consumer lines from Duracell and Energizer. However, they are within 10-20% (depending on the application), and are considerably cheaper. So, they are much more cost effective.Unless you are using them in an application where it is difficult to change the batteries, I recommend going with these instead of spending more.
This works well to reduce GERD or Gastric Reflux Disease (heartburn). It does not work instantly. Instead, it reduces acid in your stomach after a few days, allowing the esophagus hopefully to heal up.Pros: works well, was a prescription pharmaceutical now available over the counter. One small tablet a day.Cons: Not good for long term use, can give you a headache the first few days, doesn't work instantly; you have to take it at least a few days for it to start to work. Can't stay on it long term.See your doctor if you think you want to take this and tell your doctor IF you are taking it. Talk to the pharmacist about it. The guy behind the counter knows a lot, and will actually give you some good advice about taking Prilosec.
IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE READ DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USINGPrilosec OTC saved the day for me on numerous occasions when I had heartburn. This drug also fights acid in your stomach; and that's a big help! The tablets are easy to swallow and you should use them before any expiration date printed on the outside of the purple box.My one complaint is that Prilosec takes one to four days for it to give you the full effect. Although they say that some people get full relief in one day, it took me a couple of days to get the full effect. If you must have total relief from your stomach trouble right away then you need to choose another drug. This does disappoint me so I will take off one star to make this a four star review.Of course, if you have any questions about this drug that aren't addressed on the outside package then you should consult your doctor or pharmacist.Overall, Prilosec worked for me and I hope you get relief from it. It isn't for everybody because it can take one to four days for people to get the "full effect;" but it does help many, many people.Four stars.
while this is significantly less cost than pharmacy or any other market, it still does the same thing as its generic--and the generic is cheaper. I buy it simply because my wife will use it--no doubt for the box and never tried the generic that I take.
I've had acid reflux for years, and one Prilosec a day has kept it under control all that time. My cousin died of esophageal cancer, so this isn't a condition to ignore. I've tried Pepcid, Zantac, and Prevacid, and none of them work as well as Prilosec. I can eat jalape&ntilde;os at midnight and never have a single problem. I take one tablet every morning and forget about it. No lugging around antacids that don't work anyway and no missing out on foods or worrying about eating close to bed time.I really only have 2 problems with it. One is the cost, which you can work around to an extent. The other is the packaging, which is very difficult to open-- unreasonably so. I hate these blister packs with the heat of a thousand bottles of tabasco sauce. The back NEVER peels off like it's supposed to, and I have to cut open the tablet casing just to get to it. I don't understand why this can't come in a bottle.The blister packs are a thorn in my side and a hair in my cream of wheat, but at least the cream of wheat won't be giving me epic heartburn. Put it in bottles, and I'll give it 5 stars!
After being successful at not getting pregnant for the first sixteen years of our marriage, we decided to try and get pregnant.  Pregnancy tests are expensive, so we used the cheap ones (http://www.amazon.com/20x-Step-Pregnancy-Test-Strips/dp/B001FYGQ5I/) first and then once you get a positive test, then we used the digital ones.There is absolutely no question with this test.  It says 'pregnant' if you are pregnant.  The first time we were pregnant it showed about 3 days before the missed period.
There is little more annoying when you read the results of a tradional paper strip pregnancy test and of the &#34;two&#34; lines that are supposed to appear, one is really faded -looking nothing like the bold double line that is what you are looking for.  We took the test several times over several days but the line was so hard to see, and the test directions always said &#34;oh, you'll KNOW! The lines will be very obvious.&#34;  Well, this being my first child I had no idea what very obvious was, and when I googled positive test strips online those pictures were NOT what we were seeing.  Ours was (I guess) outside the norm; we had a very, very, weak second line.In any case, we were tired of not knowing for sure so I bought a pack of these Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Tests (identical to the ones I just received), and we used them.  Seeing the words &#34;Pregnant&#34; show up brought us a sigh of relief, and this was confirmed by the doctor a couple of days later.So, here's my advice.  If you are worried about an accidental pregnancy and you don't want to mess around -buy these.But if you are trying to become pregnant I recommend using the cheaper alternative first: (http://www.amazon.com/20x-Step-Pregnancy-Test-Strips/dp/B001FYGQ5I/).  AND, if you start to receive results that you are having trouble interpreting and want a more obvious test, then get a pack of these to do a final confirmation.  It'll calm any doubts you have over the other test's mixed results.Overall expensive, but recommended if other tests are not working the way you'd like.
What I liked about this pregnancy test is that it's really simple to read.  Although standard pregnancy tests (line, double line or plus sign) aren't exactly complicated to read, this certainly takes away some of the inconvenience of having to read through directions in order to properly interpret your test results.  I like that the hour glass shows you that the test is working and that you receive a very clear 'Pregnant' or 'Not Pregnant' result as soon as the test is complete.  One of the advantages over non-digital OTC test options is that you know when the test is done processing and so it eliminates the guess work of whether or not your test results are final.  One of my concerns is that I've read this test has the highest incident of false-positives.  This can cause either a great deal of distress (or) disappointment which is why I took away one star from my review.  That said, I can say that I knew for certain I could not possibly be pregnant at the time I took these tests and I did not receive a false response on all three tests taken several days apart.  I would recommend that if you choose this pregnancy test option that you either do multiple tests to ensure that your test results are consistent or of course, see your health care practitioner if you believe that you may be pregnant regardless of the results for confirmation.  Overall, I think that this is a good product that I would recommend to friends/family.
ClearBlue Easy Digital Pregnancy Test is one of several pregnancy tests I have had to purchase in my day. This time around, the request for a pregnancy test kit came at a most unusual time: When I was driving home from the airport. There I was, driving down the highway relaxing with my thoughts when all of a sudden the wife calls and says she needs a pregnancy test kit. I pulled into a drug store to make the purchase and this time around, rather than waste our time with the cheaper pregnancy tests that require reading lines, I decided to go for a more deluxe version- one that uses a digital display and that tells a woman, using actual words, whether or not she is pregnant.Besides the ease of use from having a digital display panel, the main thing that makes this test kit so much better than most others is the fact that it spells out to you, in simple English, either "Pregnant" or "Not Pregnant". With most kits, you are presented with a testing area and you have to watch closely to see if either one line or two lines of color appear. This seems simple enough, but the problem with these types of tests is that you cannot always tell if a second colored line is there or not. Often, the second line is faded a bit, or it only half- displays, or something else is wrong with it. This is incredibly frustrating because when it comes to a pregnancy test, most couples are already very anxious. To have a test kit present you with one and one- half colored lines when you need to see either one line (not pregnant) or two lines (pregnant) can really drive a person crazy. You are left not knowing whether the test is positive or negative. But with this test, there is no guesswork because the panel distinctly says either "pregnant" or "not pregnant". There are no worries with partial lines or anything else. The answer is either yes or no.Even though I love the simple, direct answer you get with this test, there are certain disadvantages compared to simpler tests. First, you have to start by inserting the test strip into the testing holder. With other tests kits, the test strip is already inserted for you so you don't need to worry about damaging it. Also, the test strip has to be inserted just right. You have to line up the arrows and push it into the testing stick until you hear it click into place. If you don't do it correctly, there is a chance the LCD panel will say "See Leaflet" or "Error". When this happens, you must eject and try again. But depending on how you mis- inserted, you may have ruined the strip, deeming it useless. This means you will have only one more chance to test for pregnancy.Speaking of the "See Leaflet" and "Error" messages, it is important to know that these can come up for other reasons, too. If the testing strip is having difficulty making a reading (like if the woman didn't urinate long enough) it will also result in an error. If the testing stick is faulty, this, too, will result in one of the error messages. If you think you have a defective testing holder, you can call the toll- free number indicated on the instruction sheet and get a replacement sent to you. Often, it is also possible to get a replacement from the store where you purchased the test kit. Depending on how anxious you are and how quickly you need an answer, you can choose to act accordingly. When we used the first test strip, we got the error message and upon reading the instructions, it told us we either had a bad holder or a bad strip. Before we went back to the store for a replacement, I suggested that we try one more time using the other test strip. We did, and this time there was no error message on the display panel. We got a clear response.One other small disadvantage of this testing kit is the lack of any way to purchase replacement strips separately. When you buy this test kit, you have only a couple of chances to use it and test for pregnancy. Replacement strips are not available, so once you have used the testing holder with the included strips, the holder is no longer useful and needs to be discarded. If you still need to take more tests, you will have to purchase another testing kit. There is no cup included either so if you prefer to use the "dip" method for testing, you will have to supply your own container.Clearblue digital pregnancy tests cost more than your basic test kit. There are other kits that cost less than half as much, but I think this kit is worth the extra cost. It is very nice to have a digital display and very nice to not have to guess whether or not one or two colored lines are showing up. If I ever need another testing kit in the future, I will give high priority to this test (or some other, similar digital test) from Clearblue. It makes life simple by giving you the "yea" or "nea" answer without partial lines or other frustrating results.
Disclaimer: I received this product to review as part of the Vine program.I gave this to two female friends and both responses were positive, with only one differing opinion and hopefully you'll appreciate their different perspectives.Here's their summary:Female #1's Response about the Grip:========================================"I didn't like the grip very much. It was too thick and felt like it would slip out of my fingers during the test. I've used the First Response Test before and like their thumb grip better because it's thinner."  [Note: This female is 5', very small-framed and maybe 100 lbs]Female #2's Response about the Grip:======================================="I liked this grip much better than others I've used.  It felt more "stable" I'd say.  I mean, this is a pretty dang awkward position and the last thing you want to worry about is dropping the darn thing and ahem, ensure you are hitting the target all at the same time - you guys just don't know..."[Note: This female is 5'5", medium framed and 135lbs]Both females like the simple "Pregnant or Not Pregnant" words - it was digital and very easy to read; they like it much better than counting lines or deciphering exactly what the color is.  One said there's nothing worse than questioning what the other tests are saying, the digital reading makes it easy.  They like the hourglass to tell you when the test was finished, because that part is not always clear with other tests, like First Response.  They were both very glad that it had a cap to put back on after taking the test, otherwise things would get messy.Given that one female that did not like the grip, but liked all other aspects of this test, they both concluded 4 stars was a fair summation of this product.
My favorite part of the Clearblue easy pregnancy test is that they give unmistakably clear results in WORDS. No guess work, no holding a pregnancy test up to a light at an angle because you think you might possibly see a faint line, and it is fun to share with others as they can read the results.They advertise as 99% accurate, but note that it is from the day of your expected period. They claim results 5 days sooner, but it is also important to note that at 5 days before you expect your period it only has 51% accuracy. Clearblue easy discloses that very clearly on the box.I noticed that there are a few negative reviews on Amazon.com. One of the reviews said that she had been using fertility medications in order to get pregnant. It is very important to find out whether the medications you use contain HCG (pregnancy hormone) before you take a test because the test is checking for the level of HCG in your body. A recent miscarriage and taking HCG for weight loss could also produce a false positive. One of the reviews said that Clearblue gave them a positive and another brand gave them a negative result. This was not because the other test was more accurate, but that Clearblue was more sensitive.The test is easy to use you either urinate directly on the test or dip it in urine. It also has a unique hourglass symbol to show you the test is working. The test also provides fast results in just 3 minutes or less.Lastly, the reason for 4 stars is that Clearblue is pricier than other brands. I am assuming that their cost of production is higher than the non-digital versions.All in all an easy and fun pregnancy test to use.
This was accurate (for a positive test) and was very easy to use. I'm not sure the digital design is really necessary. Regular "analog" tests are also pretty easy to use. I guess if you get a result other than the one you were hoping for, the digital design would keep you from second guessing the result.
I consider myself to be a bit of an expert when it comes to pregnancy tests--I've taken far too many in the last 7 years of trying to get pregnant.  I've seen a few positives and too many negatives in that time.  The "analog" ones with the two lines or the +/- drive me crazy.  I've been known to stare at it for what seems like hours trying too see if there is a line or not.  I've pulled them out of the trash to double-check (a big no-no since you should only look at them within a certain time frame or shadow lines appear).  The +/- are the worst--they gave faint false positives on every one of them for me.I am a fan of anything that keeps me from obsessing.  That is what I love about the digital tests...no guessing, no obsessing if there is a line or not.  It is either "Not Pregnant" or "Pregnant."I am a prime candidate for a false positive.  I did IVF and took an Hcg shot before the retrieval.  I also am impatient and never wait a full two weeks to take a pregnancy test. The hcg should have been out of my system within 10 days, but it can take a little longer to flush through the system. I took my first test at 11dpo (4 days before expected period - 51% accuracy according to the box) and it popped up with "Pregnant" within 90 seconds.  Of course, I didn't trust it quite yet seeing that there had been plenty of false positives reported.  I waited until the next day and took another one--within 60 seconds "Pregnant" popped up again.  Still, I didn't quite trust the results, so I waited one more day to take another test.  Another "Pregnant" popped up even faster!  The next day was my beta blood test and the results came back at 163, so the digitals were clearly accurate for me!I don't like that the results go away in about 24 hours, but that is only because of my obsessive nature--I stare at the results to make sure they don't change on me. ha,ha.  I did take an analog test at 14dpo and it came up with 2 very clear and dark lines.Overall, these are probably my favorite pregnancy tests.  They are pricey, but worth it for me not to hold the test up in every different direction in all different light to see if there is a second line.
if you are a compulsive HPTer during the 2wk waitthen i would actually get the no name brand 25 pack on hereand use this one as a back up after you get a positive from one of thoseif you are charting and know your ovulation time frame and get a negativeon the first time you tested then i would wait two more days before testing againthat is why this is nice this pack is 3 of them and not just one or even twoif you are on meds during your TTC journey then you should already knowthere are some that have been known to give false positivesand that no test is 100% accurateif you do get a negative on your first test you will be tempted to retest the very next morningbut try to resist the temptation and retest 2days after your negativethis one is the easiest one i have ever used now granted they are all rather easybut the technology is more sensitive than it was ten years agoand with this one there is no wondering what color is the line...or is it a true line..is it dark enough..if you have been TTC you know what i am talking aboutwith any of the HPTs out there
I have irregular period and so many time been disappointed with false hope.  My period maybe late up to two months and still, I'm not pregnant.  I've used so many test sticks in variety of brand (like to try different thing) and never received a positive response.  This product was not different, it gave me a negative and that was actually accurate.  Guess I can't give it a FIVE STARS on accuracy because I'm still waiting to get the POSITIVE and then compare it with blood test.  (like others did.  Sorry to hear it gives bad reading to many other reviewers)One thing I like about this test is how easy it is to use and read.
This product distinguishes itself by its digital read-out. It is very clear about the result. You don't have to ponder on the result if the pink line/cross is very light. One drawback I can think of is about keeping the result. I still have the test kit for my first baby. It brings back the great memory of that day. For a digital kit like this, the result will go away once the battery is gone. Be aware of this limitation. Otherwise, this is a great product.
I don't really have anything against this product, except that it is inordinately expensive compared to the strip-only products you can buy here on Amazon.  If you are TTC, maybe this digital one is the &#34;BFP&#34; you....I don't know...frame?  Whatever people do with their positive tests?  But I wouldn't recommend sinking your money into this for the every-week type testing that is typical of trying to conceive.  In the end, a test is a test is a test :)
What I love about these are the easy to read digital 'Pregnant' or 'Not Pregnant', it's miles beyond the old pink line tests that were wrong half the time. These tests are also very quick with the result, most of the time it's faster than the 3-5 minutes.Though on the negative side, one of the tests I took had a false positive which was a real disapointment.
Pregnant not pregnant, it can't be more clear. I'm not fond of the ones with the lines that sometimes read strangely or faintly or make you guess so you have to retake it. I was not however impressed with the way amazon shipped the item free or not. It was crushed and it would make me think twice about purchasing here on amazon even though I do purchase a good amount of items on here.
For the most part, these tests have always been fast and accurate.  I have had a few of these tests in the past that have been duds, just not worked at all, but I may have over-saturated the test.  That said, these are great because there is no misinterpretation of the results.  While they are expensive, they are great to show to someone that may not believe that any second pink line means pregnant on a regular test.  These test pretty low levels of HCG (pregnancy hormone.)  I have seen people get positive results on these with a level of 10.  A word of caution....if you open up the test, you will ALWAYS see two blue lines on the inside.  This does NOT mean you are really pregnant and the test is wrong.  These tests measure differently than a regular test, so I recommend not opening up the test at all because all you will do is drive yourself crazy.  Another thing I have noticed about these tests is that if the result is going to be positive, it will show faster, if it is going to be negative it will take a bit longer to show up.  Overall these are the only digital I would use, and I have used A LOT of tests over the past 7 years because I have been trying to have another baby for that long.  I only give 4 stars because of the unknown reason for the dud tests, but I am sure if you called Clearblue if you get a test that doesn't work, they will send you a refund or a new test.UPDATE:  I got a positive on one of these tests on 10/10/10 and my beta HCG was 11 the next day, so they are definitely very sensitive!
I've long felt like digital was the way to go when it comes to pregnancy tests. Yes, they're more expensive but, for most women, you're only going to be using them for time it takes to conceive and the ability to have a simple yes or no answer--in the form of &#34;pregnant&#34; or &#34;not pregnant&#34; on the display--rather than squinting at a line and wondering if you're only imagining it's there, alleviates a good deal of anxiety, making it worth the extra cost.The additional feature on these new versions of the countdown to an answer is also a nice touch for the overly anxious tester, eliminating at least a little of the &#34;is it ready yet?&#34; angst.At this point, the technology has assured that almost all pregnancy tests are super accurate, at least when used the day after your cycle was expected to begin (a.k.a. your first missed day), so ease of use and readability are what makes this brand stand out. For me, Clearblue excels at both, making it my go-to for each of the three times we've worked on expanding our family.
The product as any pregnancy test product offers 99% accuracy as it claims and it is fairly easy to use and the results easy to interpret.
I am a Clif bar fan, and this is my second favorite flavor.  I keep them in the car, purse and backpack for those times I either need a pick me up, or need a meal.  I have this on Subscribe and Save and get 15% off on every delivery!If my review helped you, could you please click "helpful" button below. Thank you!  :)
These are great as a low-calorie snack, as a meal replacement - anything really. They are delicious without getting that guilty feeling for eating crap -because they arent super crappy :)  . If I'm going for an energy bar, I'm going for this one and Amazon seems to have the best deals on them regularly.
This week I've tried several different flavors, so I'm trying to compare them overall.Peanuty taste and not overly sweet.Overall very good flavor.  Holds my hunger off for about 90 minutes.
I'm trying to up my protein intake while reducing calories and fat. I tried the Banana Nut Bread bar because I usually like anything banana-flavored. This is very much like eating a slice of banana nut bread. It's not overly sweet. The previous reviewer noted that it's "greasy." It does have a somewhat moist/oily consistency, but I wouldn't call it greasy. I didn't find it to be objectionable because otherwise the bar would have been too dry and impossible to choke down. I didn't think it was gritty, either.Bottom line: I like the flavor and the protein content, plus it's got some fiber (5 grams) and magnesium (25% RDA), which is a mineral I'm trying to increase in my diet. The bar isn't not over-sweet. Like other protein bars, this isn't low-calorie, so I have to keep that in mind.What I do like is that the Clif bar is another thing that I can take to work and keep in my desk, to avoid going to Starbucks or the vending machine.
These are a seasonal flavor, and they are very good.  This is one of the better ways to have a 250 calorie breakfast on the run.  They are moister than average also; I've tried most bars out there, and many are pretty dry.  I highly recommend these to those looking for tasty nutritional bars.
The Chocolate Macadamia Clif Bars are kind of sweet. Maybe too sweet for some people, but I like them.These bars are loaded with calories, which is great for endurance sports. One bar per hour should keep your body going for hours if you stay away from the red line.Not so great for mid-meal snacks since this amount of calories will make you fat if you're just watching TV.The price here is very expensive. Several local grocery stores sell them for less than a dollar each, even for single bars. Not buying from Amazon until the price comes down.
Along with the chocolate Clif Z-Bar, this is one of the better tasting "nutritional" snacks. It has just enough chocolate (from chocolate chips, see ingredient list) to impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate.This has a "Bit-O-Honey" -like chewy texture with honey overtones. Throw in some sticky peanut butter and chocolate, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, however, there is no honey. Clif gets that taste from syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients.It's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water.  While chewy, it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated?  Made with 70% organic ingredients, this bar has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie.Ingredients at the time of this review. (just in case the recipe changes):Organic Brown Rice Syrup, ClifPro (Soy Rice Crisps [Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract], Organic Soy Flour, Organic Roasted Soybeans), Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Peanut Butter (Organic Peanuts, Salt), Peanut Flour, Chocolate Chips (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Unsweetened Chocolate, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors), ClifCrunch (Apple Fiver, Oat Fiver, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Chicory Extract, Psyllium), Fig Paste, Peanuts, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt. Vitamins & Minerals: Dicalcium Phosphate, Magnesium Oxide, Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vit. E), Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Beta Carotene (Vit. A), Zinc Citrate, Phytonadione (Vit. K1), Biotin, Niacinamide (Vit. B3), Calcium Pantothenate (Vit. B5), Potassium Iodide, Manganese Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Sodium Selenite, Thiamin (Vit. B1), Chromium Chloride, Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12), Sodium Molybdate, Folic Acid (Vit. B2), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vit. B6).
It's not as good as a candy bar but it's not supposed to be.  I've tried a lot of energy bars and Clif bars are the best with Snickers Marathon being a close second.  I like the taste of almost all the varieties of Clif Bars and they are very hardy (they don't crumble or melt).
After reading reviews of many different brands of pedometers, I decided to purchase this one:  not only was it rated highly here, but also it got rave reviews from many users on the exercise web site I frequent.  I've never owned a pedometer before (well, other than the freebie from the McDonald's promotion several years ago); although I exercise daily, I'm pretty sedentary otherwise, and so I was hoping that wearing a pedometer would encourage me to move more throughout the day.Now that I have owned this pedometer for several weeks, I can report that I am happy with it overall.  It has become like an extra appendage--it goes with me everywhere, and most of the time, I barely notice it.  I was dismayed by my extremely low step totals during my first few days of use, but I've already started to make progress.  Although I do like the pedometer, there are definitely some features that could be better, so I have provided a detailed breakdown below.APPEARANCE:  The pedometer is a sleek little thing about the size of a flattened egg.  The edges are rounded, so I find it comfortable to hold in my pants pocket, although a bit smaller would certainly be nice.  The main step display is large an easy to read; there is a smaller time display as well.  I have never accidentally pushed the reset button, but I have accidentally pushed the mode button.CLIPS:  As other reviewers have mentioned, the main clip is definitely bulky and could've been better designed.  However, I have never had any problems with it falling off when it is clipped to my waistband, and I don't find it to be uncomfortable.  I also find that the smaller, safety clip is a bit bulky and awkwardly designed, and the way it is attached to the lanyard makes it stick way out (check out the photos that users have submitted).  However, a BIG plus about this pedometer is that you have the option of using it in the clip--attached anywhere on your body--OR simply tucking it in your pocket or even a handbag.  As far as I know, no other models offer that kind of flexibility.SETUP:  The initial setup of the unit is very basic.  Once you put in the battery (included; there is even a little "screwdriver" tool for opening the battery case), you are automatically prompted to set the time (be sure to set the AM/PM correctly) and then your weight.  Next, you need to consult the manual for instructions on setting your stride length--you simply need to take 10 steps at your normal pace and measure the distance that you travelled.FEATURES:  In addition to daily steps, this pedometer also keeps track of aerobic steps (steps taken after 10 minutes of continuous walking), calories (probably not accurate), and distance in miles.  Each of these statistics is kept in memory for the previous seven days, a nice little feature to have when you are trying to keep track.  Another feature which I really like is that the pedometer automatically resets to zero at midnight, so you never have to remember to reset it yourself.  (For those of you night owls, you can still keep stepping after midnight--your steps will just go towards the next day's totals.)ACCURACY:  I have found that when walking at a steady pace, this pedometer is extremely accurate, regardless of whether I have it clipped to my waist, in my pocket, or wherever.  However, there are some situations in which the Omron HJ-112 undercounts or even fails to count steps as all.  The manual notes that "The unit may not be able to count the steps correctly in the following cases:  1) When you walk at an inconsistent pace, 2) When you shuffle or wear sandals, and 3) When you fail to walk consistently in a crowded place."  Furthermore, it also notes that the pedometer will not begin counting until you have been walking for FOUR seconds.  So, what does this mean in actual practice?  For me, it means that when I am doing things where I am moving back-and-forth with frequent starts-and-stops such as emptying the dishwasher, putting laundry away, etc., the pedometer frequently does not advance AT ALL during this time.  I have come to accept this as a minor glitch; it simply motivates me to move more.  Others, however, might view this as a more serious flaw.So, for me this pedometer was a great purchase.  I'm convinced that despite its glitches, its accuracy is still well above average, and I don't think you will be able to find the convenience of being able to carry it in your pocket/purse in any other brand available.  Definitely recommended but with some reservations as outlined above.
I saw this advertised on Amazon for a whopping ===$18.74=== and realized it'd be foolish not to try.  The product was shipped quickly and relatively easy to set up; it took about 10 minutes to read the manual, measure the average distance of my steps, and then program it all into the Omron.This pedometer is fairly accurate, lightweight, and easy to use.  I find that it helps me keep track of my daily exercise levels, and is a subtle reminder sometime when I need to step it up.  Haha, pun intended.  Anyway.  The only complaint I have is that there's no light or beeping timer feature on this device.  I do a lot of walking in the evening and I don't always have a light handy to read the pedometer.  Also, I like to run for set time periods and having to actually manually check the amount of time I've been at it can be a little frustrating.  It loses a star for those things, but otherwise I've found this to be both accurate and helpful as I track my fitness level.I recommend this to anyone who just wants to monitor their activity and maybe measure progress in terms of getting more active.  You can definitely keep track with all of the simple but effective features provided in this device.
This pedometer is fairly small - I use it in my pocket and you can barely see it's there. (Smaller than a regular Altoids/mint tin, bigger than one of the mini tins.) Every once in a while I get a wildly inaccurate day but mostly it seems accurate.I love that it will give you your approximate distance walked after you've put in your stride length. I'm easily encouraged by little toys like this, so I've found myself walking more since I purchased it!
Like many of the other reviewers, I too decided to buy this pedometer only because I was tired of clipping the other ones to my belt, etc. So, for me, the main attraction was that you could put it in your pocket and it would count steps. Here's what I discovered about my unit:1) It is somewhat big. It's about 3" in length and about 2" in width (oval shaped as in the picture), and it is fairly thin. But still not too big to fit in a pocket or anything like that.2) You can use a holder to attach the item to your belt. However, given the size of this, I feel funny when I do that.3) Accuracy - This thing is very accurate when I attach it to my belt using the holder. However, when I put it in my pant pocket, it is consistently wrong. It always credits me with about 108 steps when I take 100 steps (so, it's off by about 8%). The good thing is that it is very consistent. So I always subtract 8% of the reading to figure out my 'real' steps.4) Features - I actually didn't even realize it had so many nice features until I started using the item. History back to the last 7 days is quite expected. But it displays the time while you simultaneously read your steps/miles/cal, etc. And it can count 'aerobic' steps (steps you take for more than 10 minutes continuous or at a certain fast pace). It may motivate you to take more 'aerobic' steps since these would be more beneficial than your everyday steps.Overall: While I was disappointed with the lack of accuracy when this item is placed in the pant pocket, the fact that it is consistent in its error, and the added features made me want to keep it. I think it deserves a 4 star rating and I recommend the item.
This is well built and very accurate.  I love that it stores data, and if I drop it it will not break so easily.What I do not like is it is too big for my taste.  Still, it works very well.
I haven't used another pedometer so I can't say if this model ranks better than others or not.  According to many other reviewers here, this one is more accurate than most and I'll take their word for it.I've used this model for several weeks now and given three others to loved ones.  I do find that it does indeed make me walk more - research has shown that most people put more effort into walking after they start using a pedometer.  And as far as I can tell, this model is indeed accurate for the most part.I noticed something, however, that users should be aware of.  I went through many of the older reviews for this product and found a few from users who said that the pedometer doesn't record all steps taken.  Despite all the rave reviews, this is indeed true.I've found that short bursts of walking are frequently not recorded.  However, there seems to be a difference on where you're walking that causes this to happen.  In my home where I have hard wood floors and very small carpets most steps are recorded.  In my office with wall-to-wall carpeting I found that probably only about 10% to 25% of all the steps I take were recorded.  I don't spend a lot of time walking in my office so this isn't a big deal for me.  I don't know if carpet is the issue or not, but users need to be aware that this might be an issue, especially if they're in such an environment all day long.Some have commented on how accurate this model is in terms of distance and have tested it on a measured track.  Since users enter their individual stride length - and assuming this is accurate - distance accuracy isn't really that big of a selling point.  The primary issue is the ability to record actual steps.The fact that you don't have to have the pedometer on your belt (you can carry it in a bag or pocket) is a major selling point.In most situations the Omron records my steps.  I figure it's missing a few hundred, but that's not a big deal when you consider that one should be making thousands of steps per day.  So for me the Omron works. Your mileage may vary.
Good but would not buy again............Enzymatic Therapy Acidophilus Pearls (90 Capsules).....there are so many brands nowI think there's very little difference so I'm looking into less expensive as opposed to these!~
I have only been taking the Bone Up for a few weeks and thus far, cannot tell for certain whether or not this supplement is having a positive effect on my bone health.  However, it has a very solid ingredient profile which is very significant.  Jarrow is a very respected company and makes great supplements from my previous experience with them.  As such, I am sure this one will be no different going forward.
Jarrow products have been around since 1977 and has maintained a solid reputation. I was happy to see that I could try some of their supplements free via Amazon Vine. I will not review the efficacy of each product, because every person's system responds differently to supplements, just as with Western medicine. Some folks have allergic reactions, some see no results, some see mild results, and some see amazing results.So what I will say is that when you purchase a supplement from Jarrow you are purchasing from a company known to be straight-forward about ingredients and one that has high quality standards. Even so, there have been questions regarding the trace amount of stearic acid/magnesium stearate in supplements (including Jarrow). High doses of stearic acid/magnesium Stearate cause skin damage and liver toxicity.Stearic Acid/Magnesium Stearate debate:Supplement companies use stearic acid/magnesium stearate as a lubricant when filling capsules and as a binder to hold tablets together. With reputable companies, the level of stearic acid/magnesium stearate never reaches more than 2% and is typically much less or negligible. Jarrow is not the only large company that uses this product for these purposes.Final Analysis:I will continue to use Jarrow products, but remind myself that supplements are just that: supplements. I need to focus on getting most of my nutrition through my food, but when my body needs more of something, Jarrow is one of the companies I will continue to patronize.Note:If you do some research you will find that stearic acid occurs naturally in much of the food we eat and magnesium is an essential mineral. If you want to avoid these two products in your supplements, I'm sure there are some other resources. If you know of a company that is not using stearic acid/magnesium stearate in their processing, please note it with a comment for the benefit of others. Thanks so much!
I have a rare illness that can cause osteoporosis.  Bone-Up is a great solution to keeping my bones healthy as long as possible.  My biggest complaint, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that you have to take six pills daily.  I take a lot of different vitamins and having to take six Bone-Up pills daily makes it hard to swallow my many vitamins.  I really like the Jarrow brand, but because I have to take so many, I think I'm going to look around to see if I can find a vitamin of similar quality that I only have to take one or two pills.
It is difficult to give stars to a supplement as it can only be judged on long term effects, as well as any incidence of reactions when taking such.The dosage for these capsules is 3, twice per day, a total of six capsules.  That is quite a lot of an extra supplement!While in of itself, it is not super costly, it can add up coupled with one's own particular regimen.To its benefit, Jarrow Bone-Up has quite a list of beneficial vitamins and minerals and not in those mega doses that one does not need.Having taken other calcium supplements with reactions, I am pleased to say that I have not experienced adverse effects from Bone-Up.Starting slowly with one per day, then 2 per day, I am now taking 3 per day.I do believe my 'bones' are feeling better and time will reveal more.
Supported by a clinical study, this product may slow bone loss in older people and help teens and young adults build bone mass and maintain bone health. Six capsules provide 1000mg of calcium as well as vitamins C, D, and K, zinc, magnesium, manganese, potassium and boron. Three capsules are taken twice a day, preferably with meals.Osteoporosis is the bane of senior citizens, placing them at risk for independence robbing fractures. This synergistic blend provides the promise of prevention as well as reduction of bone loss. The pills are large and taking six of them is somewhat burdensome. I had no difficulty downing them but people with issues with swallowing things may. Other than the inconvenience of taking six large pills, I suffered no side effects.  Be cautious if you are taking antibiotics. Calcium can intefere. Check with your physician or pharmacist if you are on any prescription medications or estrogen.Prior to trying this brand, I was using Nature's Bounty time released calcium. That involved taking up to four capsules a day for 1200 mg of calcium. Their capsules were remarkably smooth and easy to swallow.Jarrow is a reliable company that produces high quality supplements. I find the results of the study on this product intriguing. Of course no pill alone is a panacea. But if this product (along with a healthy diet and exercise) can stave off bone loss, the inconvenience of taking it is well worth it.
As a reviewer you'll often do strange things.  Case in point, I am a vegetarian/vegan...but basically became a non veg while using this.  Calcium from cows. :pBut a good product.  I also use the Veg formulation of Jarrow Bone-Up.  Also good that it's sub & save as of the review.
Before I had ever heard of this product, I had seen some things talking about how vitamin K2 (really its absence) might be making a big difference in how our bodies use calcium. They were concerned that it might not be properly making it into bones, when K2 would cause it to do so in adequate amounts.Looking at that and the rest of the ingredients here, I don't see much to argue with in terms of efficacy. These seem to pack together everything that is generally agreed on as good, though you'll have to do your own weight-bearing exercise if you want to maximize the effect.These aren't appropriate for vegans or vegetarians, however. It's also not okay for Hindus or anyone uncomfortable consuming cow products (considering the entire mad cow issue, though at least these aren't cows from the U.S. where the laws are slanted toward trying to avoid noticing if there might be a problem).As bone-helping pills go, these definitely seem effective. I'd tend to reserve them for cases where you really need the help, such as if you know your bones are already getting too thin. For someone who has a fairly healthy skeleton, this is probably much more than you need and kind of a waste.
I'm sure that I'll see the positive results of this product in a couple of weeks, but to have to commit to ingesting SIX of these large-ish capsules every day makes me crazy.Come on, Jarrow - can't you figure out a way to condense the ingredients of Bone-Up so that we only have to take three a day? I don't like having to a) schlep and b) remember to take vitamins more than during my morning routine.Love Jarrow products and they always come through - rethink the quantity, please!
These supplements contain vitamin C (333% of Recommended Daily Intake), D3 (250%), K2 (45%) and calcium (100%), but you have to take 6 of them a day. At that rate, this bottle is only a 20 day supply. These capsules are not small either.I would prefer that the formulation be more compact so I didn't have to take 6 daily (3 capsules twice a day).
Many of us could use a calcium supplement, especially those who are seniors or who do not receive enough calcium through natural sources.I can't tell you how many older clients I have who are consistently falling and breaking shoulders, hips and other bones.  I can't help but think that, if they took a supplement like this one, they probably wouldn't have broken their bones.The only thing I don't like about this particular calcium supplement is the dosage.  Having to swallow 6 pills is a tough pill to swallow (pardon the pun).Do bear in mind that you don't have to take all 6 pills daily.  6 pills equals 333% of your RDA, but let's say instead you only take 2 pills daily.  2 pills still gives you a bit over 100% of your RDA of calcium.I strongly believe that taking a calcium supplement is very important for those who are older and/or who don't get enough calcium in their diet otherwise.  Jarrow is a solid name and these supplements can offer a great benefit.  Taking this stuff beats the heck out of breaking a hip (or whatever).  4 stars with 1 star knocked off for the high recommended number of pills only.
I've always thought I could take straight calcium to help with bone density and it would do the trick.Reality: need to take calcium with other vitamins to help absorb the calcium. This mix of calcium with Vitamin C, D, K, Magnesium, and others. For the C and D you get 2-3 times the daily minimum. Since it has a high dose of C, you probably want to take this in the morning for an extra boost of energy.Also, since these are capsules and have powdered vitamins inside, they will break down quicker and there will be better absorption than hard, huge calcium tablets.What is difficult for just about any calcium tablet or capsule is having to take a handful of pills to get the daily dosage of calcium. No difference with these, you have to take 6!!!I've had best results with liquid calcium, but these are a good alternative, especially if I'm traveling.
I chose these because I wanted to start taking a calcium supplement and I trust the Jarrow name. I like that the calcium is supplemented with vitamins D and K to make them more bioavailable to my body. The pills are large but are swallowed easily enough. I am happy with this product.
Bone up is a supplement that not only contains calcium, but also vitamins C, D and K. If you are concerned about your bone health and do not eat many calcium rich foods, you may want to try this out. Because of the way calcium is absorbed in the body, the bottle says to take 6 a day (2 with each meal.) This would make this a little over a 2 week supply. I had no problems taking this and experienced no bad effects from it. I also give these to my dog (I remove the powder from the capsule.) I add this to his raw diet on days he isn't eating egg shell or bones. The potassium citrate in this supplement helps prevent kidney stones. Overall, another good Jarrow product. I took off one star because this contains traces of soy.
Among other calcium supplement, this is the most comprehensive one which is designed to maximize calcium absorption and is distributed to 6 servings per day - unlike the typical high-single-dose calcium that triggers high influx of calcium which would then flushed away by our body or not optimally absorbed. But then again, due to it's 6x intake per day, it requires discipline to follow the routine of 6x per day.
Many adults suffer from calcium deficiency, especially women.  Taking calcium supplements make sense for adults who don't eat or drink enough dairy products or for those who are lactose intolerant.  This Jarrow Formulas Bone-Up supplement was worth as try.Likes:>A good source of 1000mg Calcium plus additional ingredients such as vitamin D, vitamin K, Vitamin (as calcium ascorbate), potassium, magnesium, boron, zinc, copper, and manganese combined to build and maintain overall bone density.>Being lactose intolerant, I have to limit my daily intake of dairy products so this Bone-Up supplement is very helpful.>The capsules are large but still easy to swallow with some liquids.Dislikes:>Jarrow recommends taking 3 capsules twice a day,  that's 6000mg of calcium plus the additional nutrients.  How much of this calcium supplement is absorbed and just how much is excreted/evacuated is unknown.>120 capsules per bottle is only a ten days supply for two adults.Overall:To me, this Bone-Up supplement works like a bone insurance for the adults in my family.  It's still important to maintain good nutrition, daily vigorous exercise, moderate sun exposure, etc.  for overall good bone health.
After working with the elderly I saw that brittle bones seems to be one of the main reasons people end up away from their own homes and in with us.  Soda and caffeine can leach your bones and we aren't all doing our best to keep our bones dense.  I like jarrow supplements because they are reputable and they make their supplements to make sense.  Combining vitamins or minerals needed to work together.
You should check with your doctor before taking calcium supplements because recent studies (which have some flaws) indicate that there isn't as strong a correlation between strong bones and calcium as previously thought.However, if you're female and hoping to avoid osteoporosis many doctors still advise you to take calcium to protect your bones.  And along with the calcium, you need to take Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K2.  And calcium is better absorbed when accompanied by magnesium.  Jarrow formulas' Bone-up capsules contain the correct amounts of these minerals and vitamins.  Jarrow products receive consistently high ratings for their quality.The only reason I give this a 4-star rating is that you have to take 6 capsules a day (it's recommended that you split the dosage into 3 capsules twice a day with meals), which was kind of a pain to me and I often forgot to take the second dose.  Also- since the bottle contains 120 capsules, you only get a 20 day supply so if you like this formula you might want to buy a larger bottle which would be more economical.  The average cost per day (based on the price listed here on Amazon) is 60 cents a day for the 120-count bottle.Bottom line: good product, but check with your doctor first.
Calcium is one of the things I should take every day but don't, generally because of how big the pills are.  I don't get enough of it from food sources - but does anyone?  Every time they shake up that pyramid or plate or whatever it is now, it all turns into a mystery again.I have not looked inside to see if my bones are improved.  But this is the statement in their product description that made me think it was a good idea to try Bone Up: Between 45 and 75 years of age, women lose 30% of their skeletal structure and men lose 15%.  That's a lot.  I don't think I have that much to spare.I am very impressed with the quality of Jarrow supplements.  I have been using GNC for years but tend not to like the clerk in my local store.  And no, I have never seen the same one twice. Then if I try to order online, I decide to wait until the first 7 days of the month for the discount and forget all about it when it is time.  So I was happy to try out the Jarrow products because if I like them, not only can I find them again, but their prices are excellent, too!
I've tried a few other things with this brand, and I respect the research they put into it, but the amount of pills needed to fulfill their idea of a daily portion is a little crazy. Since I'm still young, I'll think of it as a supplement rather than emergency fixer, so hopefully a couple will be enough, but only time can tell...
This IS a calcium capsule, NOT a sexual performance pill, LOL!This capsule promotes bone density.It say take 6 capsules a day, 3 with two different meals, but I take one with breakfast and then one at dinner, as I take several other suppliment/vitamins as well.PS, allergy note:, this product contains trace amounts of Soy.
Jarrow's Bone-Up supplement uses the widely researched MCHC as a source for bone building minerals, along with co-factors such as vitamin K2 and D3. The vitamin K component was recently upgraded to a superior form. This is a pretty good formula, and Jarrow uses a free range cattle source for the MCHC. One thing that could improve this formula would be to include more magnesium relative to calcium and to add strontium. Jarrow has a Bone-Up Ultra supplement that is essentially the original Bone-Up with added MSM, glucosamine, curcumin, resveratrol, and flax seed lignans. The ultra version adds more support for joint health. If you already get supplements for that from other sources then you'd just need the regular Bone-Up formula. If you are seeking to maintain bone health Jarrow's Bone-Up is a nice option, although strict vegetarians would need to use the Jarrow vegetarian/vegan Bone-Up bone building supplement or seek alternatives from companies such as Garden of Life or Synergy to get quality vegan bone-building formulas.
First of all, per the label SIX capsules are a serving, 20 servings in this package.  Do the math to determine if the cost per serving is worthwhile or if there are better sources of the primary nutrients elsewhere, in higher doses, for best results.After my husband fractured his hip, had hip surgery to pin the bones back together then a few weeks later compression fractured his back (again), we knew it was time to take our bone density seriously. Unfortunately we did not get a bone scan at the time, however we both underwent a bone scan recently and we were both very pleased with the results.  Last evening we attended a medical seminar conducted by an orthopedic surgeon who spoke on fall risks with the elderly and discussed osteoporosis and bone density at length.  Listening to him I had not realized that when the bone scans were done they are compared against a 30 year old.  My bone scan came back at almost +2 which is a very good result - optimal for someone in her 40s!  My 60ish husband's bone scan came back just under 0 in the negative numbers which is still great for his age but means his bones are not quite as dense as a typical 30 year old - at twice the age!  Again considering where he obviously has come from his numbers are great and we are optimistic his bone density is still improving.How are we so certain?  Due to our supplementation we have witnessed that both of our bodies are "de-aging". Skin tone and texture is improving, skin clarity is improving, wrinkles are slowly improving.  We met a gentleman last evening at the osteoporosis seminar who I assumed to be mid 50s... he said he supplements well... he's 69! Wow, great supplementation!Per the label Bone Up consists of:Serving Size  6 capsules  Servings per Container  20Vitamin C (calcium ascorbate) 200 mg 333%Vitamin D3  1000 iu  250%Natural MK-7 (Vitamin K2 as menaquinone-7)  45 mcg 56%Calcium (elemental from microcrystalline hydroxyapatite) 1000 mg  100%Magnesium (as magnesium oxide) 500 mg 125%Zinc (optiZinc as Zinc L-monomethionine)  10 mg 67%Copper (as copper gluconate) 1 mg 50%Manganese (as manganese citrate) 1 mg 50%Potassium (as potassium citrate) 99 mg 3%Boron (as boron citrate) 3 mgOther ingredients: maltodextrin, magnesium stearate (vegetable sourced) and silicon dioxide.

(There was about 20 months remaining on the expiration on the bottle I received from Amazon. )My concern with this supplement:1)  the vitamin D3 level is not nearly high enough for real health in our book, considering we average 10k-20k iu in the summer and 20k-40k iu in the winter to maintain our Vitamin D levels near the ideal 100 ng level on our routine lab reports.  When we maintain near this level colds and flu and bronchitis and pneumonia are things of the past.  When our levels dip below mid 80s we tend to again be susceptible to getting those "common illnesses".2) The magnesium levels are not nearly high enough for restoring true bone health - additional magnesium would generally be required - preferably magnesium citrate or magnesium theonate (new version developed by MIT).3)  NASA found an interesting correlation of omega 3 fatty acids and bone health - Omega 3s are missing from this supplement.For our household (2 adult humans + 4 adult German Shepherds who take supplements for health), a more ideal solution is to take individual Magnesium and D3 supplements, a good solid whole food sourced multi-vitamin and mineral formulation (such as New Chapter 1 daily) along withLiqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottleand some Omega 3 such as Fish, Flax, Borage, Evening Primrose and/or Krill Oils. Of course we also know the importance Vitamin K2 in the MK7 version so we often takeJarrow Formulas MK-7 (vitamin K2), 60 Softgels.
That's at the current price, which is likely to change. Six pills a day is a lot, I'm not aware of any other supplements requiring that many. Then again, you're supplementing bone with calcium here, and there's a lot of bone in your body. So I guess it makes sense to take more than just a single pill every now and then. And, knowing Jarrow, this is likely one of the more effective bone supplements available. If your budget allows it, and you have a nutritional need for it, then I recommend this product. And, you can always take less than the recommended dose: I currently take one pill with each meal (when I remember), and others may also choose a reduced consumption schedule, especially if they already have an otherwise significant calcium intake. If you're getting plenty of calcium, then you probably don't need these pills at all.Other things to be aware of: the pills are relatively large, and somewhat difficult to swallow. They are plain gelatin capsules, which start to dissolve when wet. When you put them in your mouth, they get kind of sticky, so be prepared to use a bit of liquid to get them down properly.They also are made primarily of ground up cow bones (with a few other vitamins and minerals thrown in for good measure). Jarrow also makes a vegetarian bone supplement if you object to the bovine calcium source:Jarrow Formulas Bone-Up (Vegetarian), 120 Tablets***EDIT: I just noticed a news article highly relevant to this review. I've linked to it in a comments attached to this review.
My mother was recently diagnosed with pre-osteoporosis, and then actual osteoporosis (at 68). So I went and got a bone scan (I am 45) and started looking for calcium pills.I've been taking a kind of calcium with Vitamin D in it (they work well together, I'm told), but wanted to find a supplement that had everything included for bone health: the calcium, D, magnesium and Vitamin K. Bone-Up has the entire suite.It also contains Vitamin C, zinc, potassium, boron, copper and manganese.The recommendation is taking six of these capsules a day. Six! And they arent small, either, at 3/4 of an inch. Not horsepills, but not tiny.The pills are clear gelatin capsules, the kind that slide in together. The powder inside is whiteish and looks a little crystaline.The bottle instructions say to take 3 capsules twice a day with meals, to facilitate absorption. 120 pills are included.I've been taking the dose of three with meals, and at least they aren't difficult to swallow.Since this is a little more than a month's supply, I'm not sure this is a real bargain. There is a lot of calcium on the market, and a lot of it comes with Vitamin D in it. But they don't often come with the entire bone regimen, so perhaps this ends of being money-saving away.If it keeps osteoporosis away, then it's worth whatever they charge. ;)It's still a lot of pills to take every day.
6 capsule a day is a lot to take and that makes it only 20 days worth when taken at that level.This is a serious bone health supplement with a lot of thought given to what would make the calcium accomplish the goal better.It has a lot more in it than just calcium and it's important to take that into account when choosing.  For example, looking at the list below I would probably get rid of my extra D3 and magnesium supplements, though the magnesium supplement I take is specialized for brain instead of bones, so maybe I would just reduce it.  I really wish it didn't have this much vitamin C because everything puts vitamin C in it and though in double checking it various sites, it doesn't seem this amount is anywhere near where side effects tend to show up.However, the calcium level in this is high enough that serious side effects could appear from it especially if you are getting calcium from other sources likes antacids.  Also from what I'm reading the magnesium oxide level on this is higher than the recommended safe level.  I suggest you do not take a daily full dose of this supplement without consulting your doctor.  Suggest you Google the calcium and magnesum ingredients and side effects and do lots of reading to figure out the issues before you go to the doctor (because doctors themselves have varying degrees of knowledge and carefulness about nutrition).I didn't research everything in this, but I do suggest you do if you are going to take the full dose of this supplement or if you take other supplements.This is what it gives you:Vitamin C 200 mg 333%Vitamin D3 1000 IU 250%Natural MK 7 45mcg 56%Calcium (elemental) from microcrystalline hydroxyapatite)  1000mg 100%Magnesium (magnesium oxide)  500 mg 125%Zinc 10 mg 67%Copper 1 mg 50 %Manganese 1 mg 50%Potassium 99 mg 3%Boron 3mg
Jarrow Formulas Bone Up Capsules is a bone strengthening supplement that will help you get not only your intake of calcium but you'll get a boost of other benefits such as vitamin C.  The servings are three pills in the morning and three in the evening (taken with food). Each 120 count bottle will last you for twenty days.  They come in capsules that will easily digest and wont upset your stomach.  I enjoy Jarrow Formulas products because they are made of high quality ingredients.If you are looking for a calcium supplement that is filled with other vitamins and nutrients then you will want a bottle of Bone Up Capsules today.
I am a believer that there are supplements that can help us physically.  My wife has tiny bones and she's not that physically active or doesn't have high calcium diet - so I worry that her bones might weaken as she ages.  So I got this Jarrow bone-Up for her and she's been using it for about one month now.  So far she doesn't report noting any effects but I'd like to see her stick with a calcium/bone supplement.Net net I'm giving this 4-stars because I view Jarrow as a trusted brand and at around $12/bottle is good value.  If there are any notable updates I will update this review.
So does adding all those other ingredients, but they don't have silica.Disclaimer:  at 6' tall, "large" boned, heavy, and active, I am not at real risk of osteoporosis.  Grandma had it, so I need to be cautious, and I don't know what was in her diet.  I know she did not take estrogen after menopause.I take my bone supplements.  I have very high D level (confirmed by blood tests); I live in the south, I eat kale.All of this is background to saying, Bone supplements matter, and unfortunately, you hardly know until it's too late to make much of a difference whether they're working or not.Calcium is bulky; all of the pills that give "enough" are either huge, or smaller-and-several-pills per day.  Jarrow's bone-up formula is six caps / day; if you take tons of other supplements, you can probably cut back to three and stretch the bottle.Ordinarily, I worry a bit about the "complete formula" products.  IMO, 1000 mg D3 is not enough to make much of a difference in anyone's life if you live north of Washington DC, so you'll still need more of that.  Ditto the Vitamin C.  Can't understand why they bother with potassium but it is limited by law to 99 mg / pill (in this case even less because this is the dose for six pills).  Zinc may be useful but it will also be in a good multi and it's possible to easily overdose on the metals.OTOH, Calcium alone (fortified milk and other products) is not enough, either, and too much calcium mucks with your blood vessels in a bad way.  Magnesium is critical.  (So is potassium, even more so:  eat your greens.) (That is, you'll die faster if you run out of potassium, or get too much, but you'll still die if you get these electrolytes wrong.)Sigh.Supplementation is a bear.So is living with fragile bones.I think this is a pretty good product for bone health; I wish they had silica in it and recommend silica (often drops, also sold as horsetail rush) for women at risk of osteoporosis / penia (mostly, thin women particularly those who dieted heavily in their late teens and 20s whatever they look like today), esp. if you're not taking post-menopausal estrogen.  Silica helps the collagen matrix (mortar), calcium bears the weight (bricks).I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice.  Supplementation is difficult and you do have to educate yourself.
I recently had a bone density test, and came out at the low end of normal. Although my doctor was satisfied with that, I wasn't, especially after caring for elderly relatives who have broken hips from simple falls. I asked my doctor about this product and he gave the go ahead for me to try it. Taking control of my healthcare is important to me, and since I know I don't always eat the right foods with calcium, I feel good about taking a supplement that helps my bones be stronger.
The bottle didn't last long with the suggested intake amount--6 pills daily.I didn't follow the instruction fearing my stomach can't handle this many calcium pills.Ergo, I didn't see the result I might have.Generally speaking, I am happy with Jarrow's products.They are quality made and most don't upset stomach when taken under the instruction given.I am showing mild symptoms of calcium loss (due to ski injury years back and daily coffee drinker).I began taking these and the aching in my hip went away.If I stop for a few days, the pain returns.I would recommend this product but taking 6 per day is a bit much.
Women especially need extra calcium to protect their bones as they age. This is a Jarrow supplement that supplies a high daily dose.There's no way I'm going to take six of these things a day, but, still, I feel good knowing I'm getting more calcium than I get from my daily intake of soy, milk, and cheese.
This is a great combo of natural products for healthy bones. I like the combination of agent including calcium, vit D3 and vit K with proteins for effective bone buildup.Reommended.
This is a good calcium supplement, if you don't mind taking 6 big caplets a day.  I've never had a bone scan, so I have no baseline comparison to see if I have experienced any improvement after taking this supplement.  I generally try to get most of my calcium naturally through the food I eat; however, with busy schedules that is not always possible.  My main issue with this product is remembering to take 2 tablets, 3 times a day.
The pills are little large, but they are nicely coated, so they go down pretty smooth.  They seem to be helping (how do you really know w/o an xray).  Overall, these are good supplement and you get a decent amount of them for the price!
Most of the ingredients in these pills are no different than I get in my normal, much cheaper, multi-vitamin. One dose, which is six capsules (take three twice per day) contains:Vitamin C (calcium ascorbate) 200mgVitamin D (cholecalciferol) 1000IU (little concerned about this as too much D can be harmful)Natural MK-7 (K2) 45mcgMagnesium (mag oxide) 500mgZinc (zinc-L-monomethionine) 10mgCopper (copper gluconate) 1mgManganese (manganese citrate) 1mgPotassium (potassium citrate) 99mgBoron (boron citrate) 3mgThe difference is the calcium.  It provides 1000mg of elemental calcium, but this is from microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, which sounds fancier than just saying bone meal.  A search on that form, limited to non-commercial sites, brought me to a NIH (National Institutes of Health, a U.S. Government program) test on people who were at risk for osteoporosis due to long-term prednisolone use.  The difference between those who took microcrystalline hydroxyapatite and those who didn't was strong.  Another non-commercial study showed that it works well, but isn't absorbed as easily as calcium citrate.Note that because of the number of pills you need to take every day, this 120-count bottle only lasts 20 days.  That's not much for the price.I have osteoporosis that I am trying several methods to correct.  It is impossible to know if this will make a meaningful difference or not.  I can't assume a better dexa scan was due to this or my Fosamax, etc., but I need to hit this with every reasonable method.  According to the studies I have read, this version of calcium is one.  I will continue to check scientific research and use this product as long as legitimate studies show it is beneficial, but will take one daily dose instead of the two recommended and use calcium citrate for the other.
I wanted this product because  not long ago I was at a health fair. They were doing bone density scans with a machine.I was surprised to find after the test (and a retry) that I had low bone density. I have never broken a bone.I am someone who weight lifted 3 times a week and also practiced the high impact sport of parkour.I have hopes that these pill will restore my apparent low bone density.  The pills are easy to swallow butthe one problem that I have with these is that  the directions are saying to take three pills twice daily.For me that is a lot of pills and something I am not used to doing so that is one drawback . I, however, will post back  my results after Ireceive another bone density test.
Calcium is one thing we all need, especially as the years pile on.  I have both the "time released" Jarrow calcium supplement and this one.  The ingredients are similar, with the main difference being the amount of calcium - 600mg for "time released" (2 tablet serving size) vs 1000mg (6 tablet serving size) with the "bone up."  So "bone up" has less calcium per tablet. The same is true for the other ingredients - this has a smaller concentration.Of the two, I prefer the "time released" - I already take other supplements, so don't need the vitamins and minerals in "bone up."  However, if you have trouble taking tablets, this is in a capsule - you can break it open and mix with yogurt, for example. At six capsules per serving, this is only 20 days of supplements.
While I really like, and am totally on board with the components of this formula, using the recommended daily dose over time simply isn't in my supplement budget when my regular supplement is doing fine.That being said, I will continue to take my regular bone regime but ALWAYS have a bottle of unexpired Bone Up in the house. Having broken 2 toes last year, and spouse breaking an ankle a while back, I will absolutely bone up on Bone Up the minute there is a break.Same if a scan shows I need it.In my opinion, if you need the 'big guns', this is it. Otherwise, another bone formula might serve you just as well.
Hmm... am in 2 minds about this product. I got this for my wife since she has just given birth so calcium is good right? Well, she was appreciative but she thought that the serving of 6 pills a day was a chore since she already think that eating the chewable ones 3 times a day too much. Sigh. However, she likes this better than the chewable ones as they tasted 'funny' yes even with the chocolate-flavored ones. On this I agree with her as I never did liked the slightly sweet chewable calcium gums.One other thing that is good is that it caters to people who may be allergic to gluten, nuts or shellfish as it doesn't contain any of those (see below).Anyway am putting out the supplement facts in case someone out there wants to get a bottle of 120 capsules calcium product.Vitamin C (Calcium ascorbate) - 2000mgVitmin D3 (cholecalciferol) - 1000IUNatural MK-7 - 45mcgCalcium (elemental) - 1000mgMagnesium (as magnesium oxide) - 500mgZinc - 10mgCopper - 1mgManganese - 1mgPotassium - 99mgBoron - 3mgNo wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.
I refuse to take osteoporosis medicine because it doesn't build bone and can actually cause more harm than be helpful.  This formula is great because it combines many different vitamins to help build and keep bones.  I had been taking several of these vitamins separately....but now i just have to reach for this.  It saves me from having to think to much....which is helpful!!The one thing that I don't like is that they use magnesium oxide which has been reported/studied and shown that it does't absorb very well.  For that reason, I still take a separate magnesium supplement.
I've been taking these to help my bones for I don't think I eat enough calcium in my diet.  I feel a difference in the bones in my back.  It's slight, but I will keep taking these.
...that you really don't know if they're doing anything good.  From the contents of the capsules, it sounds like they should be, but without a statistical sample of the population and laboratory work, it's really (educated(?)) guesswork on my part.What I can report is that they don't upset my stomach, don't seem to affect my blood glucose levels and I haven't woken up, standing on the roof, crowing at the sun.  Of course, the same can be said about my wife's brisket recipe.Oh well...
Although people complain and/or associate the smell of Bengay with "old people", the menthol helps the sinuses and there's something comforting and familiar about the smell. Immediately after application, it's reminiscent of Vick's inhalers.I tried this product out on my shoulder and knee...Worked rather well for the shoulder ache i had, not so much for the knee. I'd recommend this for should pains over pads. Especially since it's summer, and the gel doesn't add any layer to make you hotter, nor do you have to deal with the ripping off of pads --and possibly ripping out hair.
I recently got rear ended by somebody, and ended up getting the "whiplash," a mild one, mind you. I couldn't get to a physician ASAP, so I had to find something to ease the pain. While the pain itself didn't completely vanish, Bengay made it a bit easier on me. The odor is a bit too strong, but it fades away gradually
Bengay Cold Therapy works well in targeting painfully inflamed areas.  Bengay has been well known for relieving muscle and joint pain.  This particular product offers the cooling agent which is quite soothing on sore and/or stiff muscles.  It loosens and lessens tightness and tension and its cooling effect radiates from the affected area to nearby areas.  The result is that you enjoy a long range cooling effect.While I don't care for the scent, it is not as strong as in other Bengay products.  It is very easy to use.  Just rub on a thin coat and gently rub it into the sore area.  You might experience mild tingling.  Excellent for sore muscles.  It does profide long lasting relief.
This arrived at the same time as my chronic back pain kicked in.  So, it was put to immediate use.I may be a dummy, but when I read the Amazon product description for 'cold therapy', I was thinking that it was not a typical Ben Gay ointment, but a cold pack that you put in the freezer before use.  I love those.  Even taking a closer look at the front of the box online and the words "New Ben Gay", gave me no clue that it was an ointment.  I had no idea of the size of the box itself, so this was no clue either.It smells good, compared to the old Ben Gay, which I haven't used in years because of the smell.  It did give me temporary relief, which of course is what all of these type of ointments do.  I did feel relief within a few minutes and it lasted for a few hours.It did what promised, but I am not sure that it was better than what I have been using for years... Biofreeze.  Since I have both products on hand, I switched back and forth between the two of them.  Maybe because of the stronger smell and tingly feeling from the Biofreeze, I am leaning towards it for more relief.  This may be all in my imagination, but when my back and hip hurt, all I want is relief, smell or no smell.I will continue to use the tube of Ben Gay as I do actually like it and I do feel better, but I think it may be a toss up between the two brands.
I am a fan of the traditional Bengay muscle rub that gives a sensation of heat being applied. Actually, I use the generic version. Bengay Cold Therapy theoretically works like applying ice instead of heat. Having used it several times on sore muscles, I didn't get any feeling of cold being applied, but it does seem to help loosen the muscles some. I can't swear by it, but Cold Therapy seems to relieve muscle tightness nearly as much as the traditional Bengay does. With no scientifc evidence, I would still say that traditional Bengay has the edge in effectiveness.An advantage of the Cold Therapy is that the smell is much less intense. It smells like menthol vapor rub, but the odor quickly dissipates. I also like that Cold Therapy is not greasy. It rubs in completely and you can't feel it on your skin at all.
I have used normal and extra strength Bengay for years to treat my chronic neck pain. It works well for temporary relief. I decided to give Bengay Cold Therapy a try and compare the results. Regular Bengay can make your skin feel very hot especially the Extra Strength Bengay. Cold Therapy does the exact opposite and gives a cool feeling but it works just as well in the short term. Regular Bengay normally works for an hour or so but the new Cold Therapy doesn't work quite as long. I noticed that after about 20 minutes the effects will substantially weaken. Within 40 minutes you can hardly feel it at all. Regular Bengay is very greasy and smells much stronger. Cold Therapy doesn't have an overly powerful smell and isn't greasy so you can use it anywhere without everyone knowing.If you aren't going out of the house then I would stick to regular Bengay for longer lasting results. But if you want to use it on the go then Cold Therapy might be the better choice.
I liked this product.  After a couple of orthoscopcies on my knees, I am not stranger to pain rubs.  I will admit I am more partial to heat rubs, but I liked this one.  It provided relief.  It was not overly greasy or aromatic.  I will use this one in the future.
The Bengay Cold Therapy cream reminds me of another product that is used more in the medical profession.  It does the same thing which is to provide a "minty" cooling sensation to your muscles to releive pain, cramps, etc.  To make a distinction - it is not like Icy Hot which heats up then cools off later.  This product is only the cooling sensation.  It seems to do its job and last a decent amount of time.  The scent does eventually vanish but not right away so you will spend some time smelling like a cough drop. :-)  All in all it seem to work as advertiesed and provide mild temporarty relief to achy muscles.
"Bengay Cold Therapy, 4-Ounce" has an honestly chilly feel when applying.  With older age come aching joints and "Bengay Cold Therapy, 4-Ounce really aided those problems for me. It doesn't stink like some of these meds can and washes off hands nicely after application.  I must say I prefer a roll on, but was glad the excess washed off so efficiently with soap and water.  "Bengay Cold Therapy, 4-Ounce" is a good product and my feeling would be if you have moderate arthritis this could be nicely effective for you as well.Good product.
I've tried quite a few of these "cold therapy" products and find none of them do as well as an ice pack. So I've never understood the point.Mostly, they have a superficial and fleeting effect, if at all, and who knows the effect of the chemicals (other than menthol) we absorb through the skin?This Bengay product seems a bit above average but still not a product I'd find useful. If I do need something in this category, my longtime has been a product called "Banalg Lotion Hospital Strength". I buy it at the local pharmacy (not a chain), so it might be harder to find.
I've been using the new Bengay Cold therapy for a few weeks now and find it's nothing new compared to what I've used in the past. The smell is on the mild side but it is sticky and even after letting it dry first find it sticks to my shirt. The cooling therapy action works as one would expect from Bengay products  so if you like Bengay this new product in the line works fine.
I have been a fan of all kinds of therapeutic rubs fro the original Bengay, Aspercreme, Tiger Balm, and good ole' fashioned linament when I was younger working on the farm and being a collegiate wrestler.  While they're all good for different types of aches and pains, I haven't been doing that level of physical labor for years until just recently trying to get back into shape, along with all of those old aches and pains, so I decided to try this "cold therapy."All I can say is "WOW!"Unlike the other products I've tried, it doesn't have a strong pungent smell and it dissipates pretty quickly.  Also, I like the coldness as a way to soothe those aches and pains.Definitely going to be a constant product in my medicine cabinet when I overdo it.
Bengay Cold Therapy works well for relieving muscle and joint pain. This product is similar to other Bengay offerings, though its therapeutic value is more in it creating a "cold" sensation where its applied. I've used it primarily for muscle soreness that accompanies physical exertion (gym sessions, long runs, etc.), rather than on a long-standing or chronic injury. I most commonly apply it to my upper back, calf muscles, and neck. It is superb at providing relief - by lessening tension and tightness - in the muscles, and surrounding area.The cloying scent (familiar to anyone who uses Bengay) is still present, but not nearly as intense or long-lasting.  The product, in my experience, is most effective immediately after a shower: a thin film, rubbed into the area of concern, provides lasting relief and relaxation to the area. Some may find the tingling/mild "burning" sensation unpleasant, but I find it an indicative that it's working as intended.Highly recommend this product for athletes, workers, etc., who experience muscle strain. It can provide long-lasting, effective relief in managing soreness and tightness.
My husband just had surgery on his shoulder, so this seemed like a good time to try out this new product.  It provided quick relief for his aching shoulder.  Additionally, I used it on my sore back and though it didn't provide immediate relief, it did provide long-lasting relief.  Seems like a good product for the money.  Certainly worth a try!
I've doing some self-help therapy usingThe Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition& Body Back Buddy Classic Trigger Point Massager - Pain Relief Self Massage Tool - The Best Self Massage Tool - with a 12 page instruction booklet and am happy to report that this therapy has removed the deep, aching pain I had.  However, I still have some discomfort. So I applied Bengay Cold Therapy to the painful areas. The Bengay helps relieve my discomfort for an hour or two. This is the first time I ever used a menthol product on muscle pain (actually this is the first time I ever had muscle pain).  I felt a coolness when using Bengay Cold Therapy; I didnt' feel any stinging or heat.  It  provided a couple hours of relief for me which is better than having to take Tylenol or naproxen to relieve the discomfort. This product isn't oily & dried fairly quickly. It took about 10-15 minutes before I felt its pain relieving effects. The scent doesn't linger.I was curious about how menthol helps so I did an online search and found that using menthol as a topical analgesic  can provide short-term relief. "It doesn't reach all the way to the muscle, but it does stimulate skin sensors to ease the pain."  Other sites mentioned that some people feel heat, others feel a chill  when using menthol ointment. Menthol works by 'distracting' the nerves because they're sending the heat/chilling message to the brain. The nerves can't carry the sore-muscle  message at the same time. Further research mentioned that topical menthol products are best suited to treat muscle soreness. Information on the Bengay Cold Therapy box states that it is ideal for sprains, muscle injuries & flare ups.
OK, this stuff works and like others have pointed out, it isn't as nasty smelling or oily as the regular version of Bengay, but also as others have pointed out, it's not a miracle drug and you can use generic versions that work pretty much the same. It is a good product that does what it claims to do.
When I started a new job in the trades a couple years back, a lot of things changed. One of those things was the inability to get to the gym on a regular basis. As my core strength lessened, I found myself getting more and more back injuries. I have coped with these injuries by using back braces, electric heating pads and topical "heat" ointments. I was curious to try out this new "cold" Bengay product, as a physical therapist recommended I stay away from heat for treating sore muscles. She told me that heat often just "pisses off" your muscles and they would be better soothed with cold. While sticking an ice-pack on my back was no pleasant task, it did often help, and I was hoping this product would help as well.When I received my free sample of this product in the mail, I used it that very evening. So how did it work? It wasn't too bad. The overall effect is pretty similar to the regular Bengay feeling of heat, but to a much lesser degree. It doesn't stink as much as the old Bengay ointment I used in the past, which I appreciated. It helped, but like any ointment, you have to keep in mind that this is made to soothe - to treat a symptom, not the problem. It did soothe my back, but I really need to get in more workouts to alleviate this problem in the long-term.
I've used Bengay products for years, so I was very interested to see if this new gel was an improvement over an already great pain reliever. Well, the answer is YES IT IS!  The arrival of the new gel was just in time to test on my chronically sore hip joint.  I opened the well designed cap, shot some gel in my hand, smelled that familiar Bengay  menthol aroma, and rubbed some onto my hip.  I noticed the gel is not greasy, smelled wonderful, and was absorbed into my skin, leaving no sticky residue.  So far so good! In about 10 minutes, I could feel my ache subside and relief lasted for hours.This new product doesn't have the usual "hot" feeling many rubs have, which is a pleasant improvement in my opinion. Give it a try.
The active ingredient in this gel is menthol, and that's what it smells like, along with camphor, another ingredient.  The odor doesn't last very long.  It's not sticky, goes on easily, and is absorbed quickly.I spent hours using power tools and reached for this as soon as I finally sat down.  Rubbing this into sore muscles seemed to help, and the cool sensation, which lingers for a while, is also a distraction from the ache.  It doesn't seem to do anything for my joint pain, but it only promises to help "minor aches and pains".I'd recommend it for those annoying aches and soreness, but not for real pain.
My husband and I have both used this product and both experienced a more pronounced cooling effect than you have with regular Bengay.  Used sparingly, you can barely feel it.  When used liberally the cooling sensation was stronger and the skin in question was also slightly cooler to the touch (some sort of evaporation effect?).  With full summer heat upon us already this year, this will be a welcome addition to our daily routine.  The smell does dissipate quickly.  We'd buy it again, no problem.I don't see where Amazon has provided the ingredients for this product, so I'll add them below as a courtesy.Active Ingredients: Menthol (5%)Inactive Ingredients: Alcohol, Amino Methyl Propanol, Camphor, Carbomer, Disteareth 75 IPDI, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, FD&C; Blue 1, Glycerin, Isopropyl Alcohol, PEG 7 Capric/Caprylic glycerides, Polysorbate 80, Water
I have used all type of muscle soreness creams because I sleep on my side and often have a sore neck and shoulder.  I have tried the menthol rubs from the chiropractor's office and have not been impressed.  This cream is the equivalent, but it LACKS SMELL, is NOT STICKY, and has cooling sensation that is not overly harsh like other menthol products.  As for the soreness, it removed about 70% from a crook I had in my neck and shoulder.  I kept using it but that 10-30% still remained.  I think if you kept using it it would eventually resolve 80% of your muscle soreness issues.  I probably would buy this again just mainly for the fact that it doesn't stink and it is in a pretty blue package.I do want to add that the item I received however came in an envelope and looked like it had been pre-used but that is a VINE issue and not a product issue.
I had a knee replacement 2 months ago.  I go to physical therapy & they use cold therapy on my knee, usually an ice pack.  The Ben Gay feels much like the product P.T. uses, I believe they use Blue Stuff.My knee is always quite warm, almost hot, even though the incision is well healed.  Rubbing the BenGay on gives me an instant cooling effect & relief of the slight pain still in the knee.  It is effective although shortlived.  The gel goes on smoothly.  It feels like its going to be sticky but its not sticky & leaves a smooth cool area where applied.  I find the oder pleasant & dissapears after application.I wrap my knee in an ice pack & drive & do certain chores but once its thawed the ice pack is useless.  I've started carrying the Ben Gay with me which I can apply anytime.
This is a good product that does as described. I don't think it is as penetrating as others I have used, but not nearly as stinky! I think that's a fair trade.
Taking the place of ingested pain relievers such as ibuprofen, Bengay's topical gels offer a way to experience faster relief from aches on specific areas of the body, such as neck pain, achy wrists, and so on. While not helpful for headaches or deep muscle pains, Bengay's cold therapy gel provides a nice cooling feeling on hurting joints or minor sprains.The cold therapy style gel is thicker and has less of a lotion feel than the Bengay varieties that use the massage applicator bottle, although it also seems like it provides less overall pain relief. While it doesn't numb aches and pains as well as other varieties in the Bengay line of topical analgesics, the cold feel is pleasant and provides a different sensation altogether.  There is definitely a more noticeable menthol smell from the cold therapy version than the other vanishing scent editions, but it isn't nearly as strong as plenty of other pain relief creams and gels.With very little mess and packaged in a conveniently sized bottle, Bengay's cold therapy gel helps with recurring pain or sudden flare ups anywhere you need it.
Bengay advertises many uses, however I use it for one thing only and that is my achy knees.  I have been using Icy Hot for years and was anxious to see if Bengay would live up to its claims.  For starters thy have put the product in a nice container which reminds me of a hair gel container.  The nice thing about the container is the size not too tall or wide so it fits perfectly on my medicine cabnet.  Icy Hot is in a tube and it takes up more space.  In addition the clear plastic lets me see how much product is left and is easier to get out of the container.  Score another point for Bengay over Icy Hot.  Next is the smell I had always associated Bengay with an overwhelming smell and after using Icy Hot the smell is much more subtle than I remember it and not as overpowering as Icy Hot, sore another point for Bengay.  Finally the results, my knee did feel better after about 20 minutes but it seemed to work slower than Icy Hot.All in all the Bengay is a great product that eased the pain in my knees, I prefer it over Icy Hot in all areas but the quickness it takes effect.  However I will continue to use the Bengay as the smell is not as overpowering as Icy Hot.
A number of studies have shown that glutamine is not really all it is cracked up to be from a bodybuilding perspective.  However, it is still very good for overall gut health.  I have been taking it for about a month but haven't really noticed any benefit yet, but it is really too soon to tell.  Thus far, I have not experienced any negative side effects.  The pills are standard sized white gel caps and are easy to take.  I normally take them post workout or first thing in the morning on an empty stomach on the days I do not work out.
I got these supplements mainly because I heard they helped boost immunity and give strength to the intestines to ward off IBS, Crohn's and other intestinal ailments. I've been taking them for a week and basically have seen modest improvement and a reduction of pain in my intestines. I suffer from occasional Crohn's symptoms (burning, dull pain, etc.)I am still not sure about the mental effects and am wondering how things will progress in the coming weeks as far as depression or any other mental side-effect.My only complaint is how large the pills are which makes it difficult to swallow them, especially for those who have trouble in this area or the elderly.
These come in a good size - 750 mg. You swallow a bigger pill but get a more productive dosage.These are pretty good vitamins, but they do come with one caveat - they are not suitable for vegetarians/vegans/or those who keep kosher because they contain gelatin.
I had to research L-Glutamine before taking it, and again before writing this review.L-Glutamine is an essential amino acid, and it is the only one that crosses the blood-brain barrier.  It is the most sbundant amino acid in the human body.  It is in the blood stream and in skeletal muscles.  It is needed when you are injured or sick.Fortunately, it is abundant in many foods including eggs, milk, poutry, cabbage, beans spinach and parsely.Who should take extra L-Glutamine?Anyone who is undergoing surgery, both before and afterwards, to promote healing.It may also help to increase muscle mass for those who do weight training.It has also been linked with gut barrier function, so anyone who has any type of intestinal problems might benefit from supplementing it.  It helps protect the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.I gave this four stars because I prefer to take a full amino acid supplement that contains several amino acids, L-Glutamine included.  I also drink a daily protein shake made with N-R-G Protein Powder which contains a  full supplly of amino acids.  I don't think I would try to take individual amino acid supplements, although for some people such as those I mentioned, it may make sense to supplement with L-Glutamine.I do think Jarrow Formulas is a great brand and have used their supplements for years.
I have fibromyalgia and anything that can help muscle tissue is a godsend.  Taking it as directed I am hopeful that this will augment all the other meds etc.  The capsule are large and white and again you need a tall glass of water to get them down.One short coming of having only 30 days to review a product like this is that it often takes longer to see the results.So far there is nothing jumping off the page for me but I am pleased to have the opportunity to give this more expensive vitamin a trial period and will log in at the end of the month with any results I experience.There is considerable data showing this to be a very effective substance for the body particularly after workouts.
L-Glutamine is one of the main amino acids. Although classified as a non-essential amino acid, it is often associated with :converting easily into glucose,brain nutrient and energy sourcemight reduce sugar and alcohol cravingshypoglycemiahuman blood chemistry (transports ammonia)These statements are not backed by the FDA.Nursing and pregnant women should not take these supplements.
I work out a lot...5 days a week minimum, bodybuilding style.  Glutamine is one of my essentials.  Very important to those who exercise and break down their muscular tissue to rebuild larger.  Minus 1 for gelatin capsule :P  As a bonus, if glutamine can help to protect my intestines, all the better.  Sometimes I get very mild stomach/intestine aches and hopefully, glutamine will keep them mild and help me one day not experience any more discomforts.
Jarrow Formulas makes a good product. I did not experience any problems taking this supplement and it is reasonably priced for the market place. Extended comments follow.The consensus view on supplements is that there are two essential supplements and then a wide variety of situational or optional supplements. The two essential supplements are a multi-vitamin and fish oils. I do not have a multivitamin recommendation, but when it comes to fish oils, I highly recommendNordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, 1,000 mg Fish Oil, 180 Soft Gels. High quality and no fishy aftertaste. If you are vegetarian, these algae based omega three oils are quite good:Ovega - 3 Non fish Omega DHA and EPA 500mg.That said, glutamine is something I have taken in the past for recovery and to address GI discomfort. Previously, I took it in powder form (this product:Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder, 1000g), mixed into milkshakes or in water. I find pills easier.However, dosage and cost are questions. The powder recommended a teaspoon, or about four grams. These pills are 750mg. So you'd need to take five or six pills depending on whether you wanted to go slightly over or slightly under four grams. The other issue is cost. These pills are nearly three times as expensive as the powder.In conclusion, I would recommend if you are not supplementing with a multivitamin and fish oils to start there before adding glutamine, unless you have a very specific reason to do so. If you decide to start supplementing with glutamine, figure out what dosage you plan to take and weigh convenience versus economics to decide whether the pill or powder form makes the most sense.
Like other Jarrow Formulas products, this item is devoid of unnecessary or unnatural fillers.  The bottle contains 120 capsules, each with 750mg of L-Glutamine.The ingredient ist is:Magnesium stearate (vegetable source), cellulose and silicon dioxide. The capsule itself is made of gelatin.  The product contains no wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts or tree nuts.Unlike most supplements, L-Glutamine is best take on an empty stomach.Im a big fan of Jarrow formulas products, and this one is no exception.As for L-Glutamine itself, you have to decide for yourself as to its effectiveness and so on.  My wife and I take it more for its benefit to the intestinal system than for muscle/tissue benefits.  My wife has a sensitive stomach, but typically finds a regular dose of L-Glutamine helps her.It also has the ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and helps provide glutamic acid which the brain uses as fuel.
I actually like this product.  Jarrow is a long established and trusted company in health related products.  I liked this when I used it previously and was delighted to see it being offered via Amazon.  If you DO decide to take this, heed all warnings and instructions.  If you run into any of the side effects, STOP taking it immediately if not sooner.  Most likely you won't run into side effects, so again, if you take this, be sure to do so after you've done a rigorous workhout.  This way you will avoid sore stiffness after you work out.
This is another one of those products that I am excited about using, but realize that it is difficult to evaluate if it is doing what it says it does.Since I work in the field of neurology,I have heard of one of the neurotransmitters that is created from conversion of L-glutamine.  But the literature (lay & medical) has very intriguing findings and non-findings regarding this "non-essential" amino acid.Much of the literature does agree that L-glutamine seems to be conditionally essential in that it is very much needed in certain body conditions (high stress, hospitalization, some intestinal diseases,boosting of the immune system at specific times).However, claims regarding its exercise recovery ability have been disputed by the scientific literature.Additionally, there is some thought that if given in non-stress states, it may actually be a factor in the creation of certain illnesses (diabetes, etc.)When I google the following term- L-glutamine nih - many results return with abstracts (summary results) on several studies over the past couple of decades.Since I am not an athlete or under high stress (such as hospitalized in the ICU), based on the literature I would relegate the use of this amino-acid supplement to unusually high stress since glutamine levels have been found to drop during such times.The capsules are easy to swallow and the recommended dosing is not large compared to doses mentioned in some of the clinical trials on NIH's website.  I recommend doing the homework, and also considering looking up the various foods that naturally contain this amino acid as an option for purposefully supplementing.
I tried Jarrow's l-glutamine and decided to stop taking it right away. It made me feel depressed and gave me a great deal of stomach distress. After some research on this supplement I found that it increases Dopamine levels and reduces Serotonin. That makes perfect sense since I have never dealt well with Serotonin inhibitors, or supplements that increase Dopamine levels (like tyrosine). The stomach distress is an issue I sometimes deal with when taking certain supplements or vitamins, and this one failed the test. I'm still giving it 4 stars since the issues I'm having are related to my own health rather than the supplement's performance. It obviously has some "kick" to it or I wouldn't have had the reaction I did. I still LOVE Jarrow, and in all fairness...am just not a good candidate for this particular product. I also wanted to share my experience for those people who are Serotonin sensitive, or who have been taking meds or supplements to INCREASE your Serotonin uptake level (Prozac, Paxil, St. John's Wort, SAMe, 5-HTP, etc). You may not like the effects if your brain chemicals are balanced this way. In fact, if you're taking any anti-depressants (I'm NOT, btw) I would proceed with caution & ask your health care provider if l-glutamine is safe for you. Apparently, it can also cause rapid heartbeat, chest pain, blood in urine, and other quite scary side effects which may NOT be related to a high dosage.
I've been taking this for a little whole and have notice that some reoccurring pain I had been experiencing has reduced dramatically.  Glutamine is an amino acid that helps the body in many ways. If you work out or do a lot of heavy lifting, this may be a beneficial supplement for you.
We get glutamic acid from most if not all foods that contain protein and it's the most abundant free amino acid in the body. Glutamine is released by nerve impulses. It's used to counter some of the side effects of chemotherapy and nerve pain. But it also seems to play a role in mood and even ability to sleep well.This is a good supplement for restoring vital organs after taking many types of medications, for countering anxiety and high stress effects on muscles and even for alcohol withdrawal.
I wanted L-Glutamine to help repair my stomach.  I know I have an ulcer and obviously leaky gut as well.Excerpt from the Life Science Pharmacy:This amazing amino acid provides the nitrogen that is necessary for proper lymphocyte function making it an important supplement for those individuals with immune issues.L-Glutamine, the 'L' referring to a particular property of the amino acid, can be an amazing aid in healing stomach ulcers, stopping diarrhea, repairing a "leaky gut," and helping the body repair its cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.Repairing a "leaky gut" often categorized by diarrhea, flatulence or bloating:The dose here will vary from person to person, but I have found that in some cases it may require as much as 30 grams a day. I suggest using only powdered L- glutamine for this, due to the high doses necessary to achieve these benefits.Week One: One quarter (1/4) teaspoonful (approx. 1000mg) three times a dayWeek Two: One half (1/2) teaspoonful (2000mg) three times a dayWeek Three: Three-fourths (3/4) teaspoonful (3000mg) three times a dayWeek Four: One teaspoonful (4000mg) three times a day.Most supplements for stomach healing are 5000 mg. so not sure why Jarrow's Formula is at 750mg.  For a little more money you can buy their 1000mg capsules.  The powder is expensive, not sure why that is either since they didn't have to go to the expense of putting it in capsules.  After these are gone, I'm buying the powder.These are small and easy to swallow.
I take L-Glutamine supplement regularly as it gives great support for forming muscles and helping to battle fat in the body when exercising.  The Jarrow capsules are easy to take, have no aftertaste or burp back, and seem to work just as well or better than other L-glutamine supplements and powders that I have taken.  They seem to be high quality and I have seen no lag in performance compared to the other brands that I have used.
The Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine 750mg, 120 Capsules are a slightly large 7/8"x 5/16" diameter clear gel cap. If you don't tolerate swallowing capsules the clear 2 piece gel caps are easily opened to release the flavorless white powder that can be sprinkled over your post exercise yogurt, smoothie, etc. the recommended use being on an empty stomach or after a workout. Taking the powder directly feels soft in your mouth with a very slight sweetness. Although it does not dissolve and mostly floats in liquid, adding to any food makes the L-Glutamine supplement completely unnoticeable.Labeling indicates the Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine is recommended to protect muscle tissue and support immune function. As with all supplements you should discuss with your Dr. to find what is right for you, especially if you are taking prescription medication.I can only attest that my short term use of  Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine seems comparable to other brands I have tried.
This was recommended to me and I've never used it, though I lift hard three times a week.I noticed my recovery time was faster, when taking this after working out.So I increased my weights, to see how much harder I could push myself. I hit new highs, and can't exactly attribute that to the glutamine. But because my recovery is easier, it's also easier to push myself.I'll now use this a part of my regular training routine.
L-Glutamine is always recommended in fitness magazines.  Glutamine plays key roles in protein metabolism, cell volumizing, anti-catabolism, and helps to support new muscle growth.  I always add L-Glutamine to my supplement routine when working out.  Jarrow makes great supplements, and are very affordable.  Based on scientific data, I would recommend adding this to your diet, especially if you are lifting weights.
Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid.  90% of all synthesized glutamine are produced by muscle mass.  Glutamine is involved in a wide variety of body functions including protein synthesis, acid-base balance in the kidney, a cellular energy source, etc.I sprained my left shoulder in early March due to excessive upper bodybuilding workouts.  My physician recommended the usual NSAIDs, rest, heat to increase circulation around the shoulder muscles and tendons, and also Glutamine supplements that may help speed up recovery.  I immediately selected Jarrow Formula's L-Glutamine 750mg capsules to give it a try.For the first 15 days, I could barely lift up my left arm and there was moderate pain during the workday but intense pain when lying down or sleeping.  I took two capsules of this 750mg L-Glutamine on an empty stomach since the beginning of my shoulder injury.  I wasn't feeling any major improvements until the 25th day when I was able to move my upper left arm above the horizontal plane.  On the 30th day, I was finally able to lift up my arm vertically but there was still some minor soreness.Overall:The combination of rest for the left arm/shoulder, NSAIDS, topical analgesic ointments, and the L-Glutamine supplement helped recovery from my moderate shoulder injury.  It seems to me this injury recovered faster compared to my previous muscle injuries.  Just how much the Glutamine supplement contributed to the healing is hard to determine.
I read through a ton of reviews before trying this product.  I've never used a supplement before in my life.  I walk long distances (5-12 miles daily) and was having some muscle issues that I hoped this would help with.  Maybe I don't understand how it works and that isn't what it's really for???  I started taking it right after my walks, but really didn't notice any difference when it came to muscle pain.I also read that it helps with carb cravings.  I didn't notice this either.  Sure wish I would have!!!On a good note, it didn't cause any side effects.  I couldn't even tell I had taken it.  I know some people complained about GI issues, but this was never a problem for me.I gave the item 4 stars because I'm not 100% sure it is intended for sore muscles due to cardio exercise as opposed to weight lifting and also because it didn't cause negative side effects.  I also realize some things work for some people and not others.  I do plan to continue to take this until I complete the bottle.  If, down the road, I notice that it's working (maybe it takes more than a few weeks), I will definitely update my review.
Like others have said, it's hard to tell if this (or any) supplement is really effective after only using it for a brief time.  I do like that it is soy free and claims to be pharmaceutical grade.  I don't like that it has magnesium stearate.  I am hoping it helps my immune system as that's what my challenge is.  I do respect Jarrow as a good company.
So what does it do: Protects Muscle Tissue & fuels the enterocytes (intestinal cells) for a healthy intestinal lining.)Where does it come from: Jarrow L-Glutamine is manufactured by microbiological fermentation.Microbiological fermentation - hmm.  I usually like to know what is being fermented before I put it in my body. I attribute that to watching the Charlton Heston / Edward G Robinson movie Soylent Green when I was a teenager many many years ago.I did learn some terrific things.Glutamine is in meat, spinach, parsley, milk, yogurt and cheese.If I develop Celiac Disease (auto-immune disease from gluten aka wheat etc) this can help heal the intestines.Glutamine can be a supplement to glucose and may reduce sugar cravings. It is supposed to correct brain chemistry after a few months of use.Make sure to take on an empty stomach taking 6 caps a day (if you can afford it) in powder form mixing it with liquid to absorb the most.
Seems impossible to know if L-Glutamine is really doing anything. I've worked-out w/o it and with it. My muscles seem to recover. I decided to give it a try as I'm not the spring chicken I once was & figured a little insurance can't hurt. I don't notice much of any difference, though. Don't really want to get into the habit of taking a million supplements, all making unquantifiable promises, though. So, I probably won't order more.That's my take on L-Glutamine. As far as Jarrow Forumula's version, I suppose it's as good as any. Based on my experience with JF, it's probably one of the best brands you can go with & it's reasonably priced.
Great dietary supplement to have. It helps support muscle tissues and boost immunity. It does pass the blood brain barrier and has been know to have soothing calming propteries. As with all supplements this one should be used under the care of a doctor. *Warning do not use if you have bipolar problems or are pregnant.
Since I have been taking these tabs everyday, I have noticed that I recover quicker after my grueling weight training.  My muscles are not sore as long - sometimes a day or two less.
The makers of this supplement claim that L-Glutamine (an amino acid) helps repair muscles and protect the immune system.Generally, I am pretty skeptical of these types of claims, but about four years ago I read The Rosedale Diet by Dr. Rosedale. He had recommended these in conjunction with a variety of other supplements including l-carnitine and CLA. Basically l-glutamine is an amino acid that helps repair broken down muscles. When you workout or lift weights, you become stronger because the muscle breaks down and then repairs itself (thereby becoming stronger). L-glutamine speeds and makes the process more efficient.On another note, if you are allergic to wheat, gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, peanuts or tree nuts, this product is safe as it does not contain any of these items.
L-Glutamine naturally occurs in the human body and in fact is the most abundant amino acid found there.  L-Glutamine is classified as non-essential though it may become essential to the body in times of intense physical stress thus its popularity with people doing exercise routines to build muscle.  Other benefits of the product include include support for intestinal cells and extra immune support when the body is under stress.  The brand of L-Glutamine sold by Jarrow is available on Amazon for $.07 - $.08 per pill which seems fair as Jarrow is a manufacturer known for quality and integrity.  The capsules are encased in geletin, wheat gluten and soy free and are relatively easy to swallow.  I just started taking L-Glutamine supplements and I will update this review if I notice either negative or positive results to my overall fitness that I attribute to this product.
Jarrow is a quality company and so it's hard to complain about these capsules. Again, it's hard for a non-scientist to truly rate such products since the affects are evident (to me) and even when they are it's not clear if you should attribute it to the placebo effect.
As several other reviewers noted, one of the side effects of this product can be increased heart-rate.I took the tablets several times after exercise and noticed an increased heart-rate after the 3rd use. I decided to discontinue using them as I have HBP.  I don't fault the pill and it is clearly stated as a possible side effectBeyond that, they did seem to work to help "recover" after the workout.
This family loves Jarrow Products!I was reading up on the benefits of supplementing with L- Glutamine and found something interesting that I didn't know about the product. Let me share that with you...Because of sugar craving decreasing ability it also decreases the desire for alcohol and is useful for recovering addicts (Prescription for Nutritional Healing A to Z Guide to Supplements 1998 page 98). I'd like to make a reccomendation to the readers of my review... While our family swears by Jarrow products for health & healing (I'm one of the only known living survivors of a Grade 5 liver laceration, my mother is a breast cancer survivor who is presently 14 years cancer free after a RADICAL life change to her dietary habits and the powerful healing hand of the Lord) we always believe you need to educate yourself on supplements before you just take them. Many times you might be taking a supplement that reacts badly with your present health condition. I suffered the harsh ramifications of this myself. I took the perfect dose of fish oils as per my chiro and it wound up being the wrong amount for a person with portal hypertension and resulted in a massive near fatal bleed. Very scary.Taking in your vitamins by food intake is always the best way. But if you need to supplement read the risks of each carefully. :) Try to get those vitamins in the best way possible and when you can't... then supplement. Ever thought of juicing your fruits and veggies?? Can't stand the thought of that? Look in Hallelujah Acres site (link below) and find their supplements in lieu of juicing for those like me who aren't fond of the gritty taste. Or consider turning your juice into what some call 'green thickies' or green shakes.Happy Health to you![...]
The only thing I can really review about this product--since I am not qualifies to attest to the efficacy of glutamine--are the physical attributes.1) The pills are easy to swallow2) The dose of 750mg allows one to take 1500mg--a common suggested dose for glutamine--in just 2 pills
I guess I could rate this as 5 stars but gave it just 4 because I really don't have enough information to determine how beneficial this has been for me.I started adding L-Glutamine to my fitness regimen about a month ago and the Jarrow product is what I've taken because I do trust in the Jarrow brand.  I take one 750mg capsule after my morning workout - either weightlifting or running.  As suggested on the bottle, I take it usually right after the workout and on an empty stomach (or close to empty).  I get up at 5am to work out so it's hard for me to eat that early anyway - sometimes I will have half a protein bar or a small protein shake pre-workout, though.I only started seriously working out just over a year ago with the goal to lose 25 pounds.  I've lost the weight and continue to eat healthy and workout in order to maintain my fitness.  Since discovering weightlifting I have learned a lot about how the muscles work and the crucial time is actually after the workout when the muscles are rebuilding after being worked.  As a 48 year old female I'm not in this to become a body builder, just healthy and strong.  So after reading about L-Glutamine and its value in aiding the muscles as they rebuild, I decided to give it a try.  I can't say it's totally attributable to the L-Glutamine or not, but since taking this product I have noticed an improvement in muscle tone and recovery time (not as sore for as long of a time after a new workout targeting different muscles).I also like the fact that this comes in 120 count bottle - if you're taking just one a day, that will last you 3 months.  I've read about various amounts of L-Glutamine to take and I see other reviewers have commented about taking more or less than these 750mg. So far, for me anyway, this seems to be a good amount.
I specifically picked up this supplement to use as a sort of healthier stand-in for Ibuprofen, to mix with a sulfur supplement (also by Jarrow) that covers joints and softer tissues.I lead a very active life, running, hiking, backpacking, caving, paddling...and these things can often lead to soreness. A good soreness, truly, but still.Since "Vitamin I" (Ibuprofen) isn't that great for the liver, I am interested in supplements with anti-inflammatory properties.I take it on As Needed basis. Is it effective? It speeds healing and muscle recover after physical stress, which is a welcome effect. I will be keeping these supplements around.NOTE: It is advised to take these capsules on an empty stomach, or after a workout.
Athletes like L-Glutamine because it's purported to increase natural HgH production and aid in muscle recovery after exercise.  But it's also good for the intestines by helping to absorb nutrients better, and also line the intestinal walls. Some people also find it beneficial after surgery to aid in a speedier recovery.  I'm not sure about all that, but would like to see if it helps with my chronic injuries by assisting my muscles.This is definitely one of those supplements that's hard to quantify it's effectiveness in a real world setting.  Sure, in a lab, they can test it for all kinds of results.  But in the real world, it would be near impossible for anyone to attribute specific, quantifiable results directly to this supplement.  There are just too many other factors, and no one is using this in isolation, at the behest of all else.So, going totally on blind faith and face value, this seems like good quality L-Glutamine.  It's 750mg per 1 pill dose, so at 10 bucks for 120 pills, it's cheap enough to try for an extended period of time.  We'll see if I keep using it though; I doubt I will.  The value of amino acids is as basic as it gets.  But time will tell if I can attribute specific results directly to this.  If I can, I'll keep using it.  If not, then I'll likely conclude I'll be better off with a more rounded amino acid complex. My 2 cents.
This is good glutamine, I take it before workouts and it's easily absorbed and works well. Pretty much the same as most well-made glutamines, so comparison shop and see if this offers good value for you. Goes well with a protein smoothie.
I ordered this product via the Amazon Vine Program. For the first couple of days, I was a bit dizzy, but that soon wore off. I can notice a difference in my energy. Ironically, I notice my allergies are not as bad, and this was not one of the indications of the product. These pills are pretty large, I suggest taking them with orange or apple juice to try to mask the smell and the taste. They are gluten free which is great since I'm on a vegetarian, gluten free diet. I'm only a couple of weeks in. I will post an update at the end of the bottom . . stay tuned . .
I have to write reviews for vine products within 30 days of receiving, which means supplement reviews suffer as a result.  It is a rare supplement that shows marked changes in a person that quickly.I am taking the L-Glutamine primarily for gut health and immune system support during a stressful period.I have had no negative reaction to this product and am optimistic that I will see some benefit during the next few months.Should that not happen, I'll update this review.  Part of my positive rating is based on consistently good experience with Jarrow.
As with any supplement, I highly recommend speaking to your doctor about it. Glutamine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins), found naturally in the body.As stated on WebMD, "Glutamine is used to counter some of the side effects of medical treatments. For example, it is used for side effects of cancer chemotherapy including diarrhea, pain and swelling inside the mouth (mucositis), nerve pain (neuropathy), and muscle and joint pains caused by the cancer drug Taxol. Glutamine is also used to protect the immune system and digestive system in people undergoing radiochemotherapy for cancer of the esophagus. Additionally, glutamine is used for improving recovery after bone marrow transplant or bowel surgery, increasing well-being in people who have suffered traumatic injuries, and preventing infections in critically ill people."I'm currently working out 5 days a week, with a few of them high-intensity, and it's been stated that prolonged high-intensity exercise has been shown to decrease glutamine levels, which may result in glutamine deficiency. The body can make enough glutamine for its regular needs, but extreme stress (the kind you would experience after very heavy exercise or an injury), your body may need more glutamine than it can make, so it's good to consider a glutamine supplement.I haven't suffered any negative effects from taking this supplement and Jarrow Formulas is a brand I regularly use and trust.
L-Glutamine is the king of amino acids/proteins. The ultimate building block for muscles in it's pure form. Easy on the stomach. Highly Recommeded.
