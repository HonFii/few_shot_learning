Right out of the box and ready to go !Everything here is a 5 star from the packaging to the product.Charged fully --even though I did not  use them immediately.Fits great ..packaged great --opens easy all good on these.
In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone.
At 2500ah, these rechargeable NiMh batteries provide more power fully charged that regular alkalines.  My bicycle headlight shines brighter when I use these.  In my digital camera it makes it able to shoot 3 frames per second.  Get the Sony charger to go with these.  They will last a long time.  I am sold on NiMh rechargeable batteries!
I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days, so rather than go broke buying batteries, I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included, which gives us a set to put in her leap pad, and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well, and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money, especially if you go through a lot of batteries.
I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy, a chase-the-mouse-tail toy, and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate, so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries, and the cats don't notice the difference!
Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting, lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some, but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!
Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this, I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand, or even Energizer, I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus, this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them, and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly, highly recommend!
For me, I use the Duracell Coppertop 9-V Alkaline Batteries for two purposes:1) In a older portable FM/AM radio that accepts a 9 volt battery.2) My three smoke alarms.Before I discovered the Duracell 9 volt batteries, I used a store brand (generic) and sometimes other name brands. All of the generic or cheaper brands did not last long.1) Older Generic - In my smoke alarms - they ran out of juice in just 6 months as I discovered when the smoke alarm beeped in the middle of the night.2) Radio - The generic and cheap brand lasted about one year, but no more.BELOW IS WHAT IS HAVE RECEIVED WHEN I USE THE DURACELL 9 VOLT:1) Smoke Alarms - So now I get at least two to three years!2) Radio - I still have the Duracell battery in my radio and it is still strong. I placed it into the radio in 2008 so it has been in there for FIVE YEARS. Note, this radio I play when the power is off and bring for emergencies etc.Highly recommend these Duracell Batteries.
Of all the batteries I use, I really dislike D size. They're heavy, and I understand that they have to be. So the question was, do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries, but from my experience, these just keep going, and going, and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons, skunks, and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia), I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and the light is still as strong as ever.
I've used Duracell batteries for years, and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023, more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries, and if you don't need all eight of them now, the packaging also serves as a nice, resealable container. Also, it was extremely easy to open, needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply, except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in, and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer.
Batteries...they work, they last as expected, no worries, no high praise, good product, safe buy...looked specifically for "coppertop" not disappointed bought for pool vacuum . Thanks
Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected, pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically, these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok, these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years.
Duracell makes a great battery; and the "CopperTop" version of these 9-volt size batteries does indeed last longer than pervious types of 9-volt batteries by Duracell. These batteries always last a good long time after I install them in a smoke alarm I have.Of course, these 9-volt batteries can be used in anything that requires them--not just smoke alarms. Moreover, the reclosable storage pack actually does close neat and clean for you so that the batteries remaining inside the package don't get dusty or exposure to any elements if you're outside camping or something.Use these batteries before their expiration date. The expiration date will always be several years into the future; but some people still have them lying around in a dresser drawer anyway. The problem is not only do they lose their potency; the batteries also begin to corrode.Do NOT dispose of these or ever place these in or near a fire. They could indeed explode. I wouldn't carry them loose either--they should be protected in their cardboard case or they should be already installed in your smoke alarm, your tape recorder or whatever device you placed them into.Overall, these Duracell CopperTop 9-volt size batteries are the ones to choose if you need 9-volt size batteries. I highly recommend them for any device that needs 9-volt size batteries.
There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very, very thorough, erudite and insightful job of it.  So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters.  I am the last person on earth to demean batteries. I mean, where would we be without them?  No flashlights, no little handfans. No smoke detectors. Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel? I remember those days and it was hell.  No, we need batteries. Without batteries, our favorite gizmos would be useless...but how do you tell them apart?The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike. They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight, making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom.  I am happy to report that they did not explode, burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior.  I remember in the old days, batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you. You'd open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting. I have never seen a Duracell do this, but to be fair, I have seen no other battery do it either, not for many, many years. Obviously we have come a long, long way in terms of Battery technology.The D, by the way was plainly marked, so there could be no mistake...although the size is a dead give away. In the box with your other batteries, they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts. So were the little Plus and Minus signs, so you would know which end went in first.  Although they could have been a little bigger, now that I think of it.  A lot bigger.  But none of the other batteries offer this large print, so I won't take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies "Durable" so I expected a tough battery -- but really, how tough does it have to be? I'm not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight, am I?  So duration is really the only thing to measure, beyond the other factors previously mentioned.  Now I know some batteries claim to last longer, the energizer bunny and all that, but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less, so it's hard to judge.  I'm assuming if one really did outperform all the others, it would be common knowledge, but it's not, so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating.  On the other hand, I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store.  I think they were call Emmagizers, so naturally I was fooled.  They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice, particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker.  So, five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment, sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors, and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question: Wouldn't it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably, when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer, the flashlight that burns out requires Cs, and when you buy C cells, the next Gizmo needs Ds.  And it doesn't matter anyway because when you get to the store, you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size.  And those little guys, the AAs? What's the story with them?  How many penlights are we carrying around already.  And don't get me started on those square guys. And while we're at it, how come there are no B cell batteries? One more thing...those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery...the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery. SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious...like it's all being rigged by some international battery cartel. I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off.  Good night.
I keep this in my globe box for emergencies, additional to my 3 D's maglite. They are really useful and tough
I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It is light and great for him to use quick at work or hand free if need be!  The light is bright and a great buy!
A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins, trolls, werewolves, and lions, tigers, and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very, very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion.
Maglite flashlights are renowned for their top-notch quality, their waterproof / water resistant design, and their extremely durable and corrosion-resistant aircraft grade aluminum casing. The Maglite AA Mini Flashlight (model: M2A01H) is no exception.Pros----- Comes with a HolsterThe holster has a loop for threading a belt through. It is well-stitched and made of durable nylon.- Waterproof / Water ResistantThe Maglite is immersible in a few feet of water.- DurableThe aircraft grade aluminum makes the casing of the Maglite extremely durable and completely corrosion resistant.- Small and PortableThe Maglite is handy for emergencies, hiking, camping and other uses - and its small size makes it very portable for taking it along anywhere you go so you wouldn't be caught without a flashlight when you need one!- Well-Crafted and BeautifulCons----- Painted ExteriorThe black paint of the exterior is extremely durable but it can get inadvertantly scratched off. If that's a concern, I'd recommend the silver Maglite, which has a bare, unpainted aluminum surface.- Incandescent Flashlight BulbThe incandescent flashlight bulb that comes with the Maglite can blow out, especially when subjected to extreme temperatures.LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement-------------------------------TheTerralux LED Flashlight Bulbis an LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement for the Maglite. LED light bulbs are brighter, use less energy, and have a 30,000 hour lifespan.Conclusion----------The Maglite Mini Flashlight is waterproof / water resistant, portable, and has an extremely durable exterior. If used with an LED flashlight bulb, the Maglite Mini Flashlight is an extremely bright and reliable light source that consumes very little battery power. It just doesn't get any better than this!
These are great little, indestructible, basically bullet proof flashlights that go just about everywhere with us. We have them in our car glove boxes, boat cabinet and under every sink in our house. There's a longer one near our front door that serves as a bright torch and also a defensive baton if need be.Carry one in my range bag too, as it lights up just what i need it too in order to make those fine adjustments.Highly recommended.
Purchased a year go and love this little flashlight.  I have it hanging on my front door ona little hook, so I always know where it is.  Used it too many times to count, so nice to have one around.  And AA batteries last forever, still have not changed mine.Candle feature is so useful as well.  If people ask me what flashlight to get, I immediately point to this Maglite.
I purchased this for my weather station.  It has a unit that you install outside to measure outside temperature more accurately.  I am using low discharge rechargeable batteries and they can't handle the below freezing temp; they are showing almost empty after just a couple of weeks.Lithium batteries are rated to perform even in extreme conditions from -40 degree Fahrenheit up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Also, you have to hold to realize how light are these batteries compared to other conventional batteries.
Even so, they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However, when they die, they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do, when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken, these can be recycled????
I didn't buy these on Amazon, but I was so happy with the performance of these batteries, I had to add my review here.I recently inherited an old Olympus Camedia E-1 digital SLR Camera, and as I soon realized, the camera eats regular batteries at an astounding rate. The normal batteries I had at home were lasting for maybe a dozen shots before they would completely die. I ordered some rechargeable lithium batteries from Amazon, but I needed an inexpensive set of batteries that would get me though for a few days until the rechargeables arrived. So, I went down to my local office supply store, and picked up a 4-Pack of Energizer Lithium batteries hoping that they would do the trick. They did. I did a lot of shooting over the weekend that I was waiting for my rechargeable batteries to arrive, and I even used the LCD display occasionally to shoot with and to review my photos (something that, on this camera, would make other batteries die instantly). But the Energizers continued to work great.A week later, I had my rechargeables, but the energizers were still working, so I decided to keep them in until they died. I haven't done a whole lot of shooting...mostly a few shots here and there on weekends, as I get used to how the camera works. I was surprised when the batteries lasted through another weekend. Then another, then another. These batteries literally got me through two months of casual weekend shooting (say, a couple dozen shots or more per weekend), even with the LCD display on. For a relatively inexpensive set of "throwaway" batteries, and knowing how poorly other batteries performed with this camera, I couldn't have been happier with the performance of these. The Energizer Lithium batteries gave me serious bang for my buck.I'm absolutely sold on these batteries, and will definitely be buying more as backups to my rechargeable set.
I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations.
I have used these before. This 8-pak is priced better than a 4-pak at W-Mart. These batteries are great for digital cameras, they go much longer than regular alkalines.
I have a Microsoft mouse that insists upon the batteries being at top voltage.  These AA Lithium batteries are the only ones that will run for a long length of time.  Rechargeable only work about two weeks.  Alkaline batteries work about six weeks.  And these lithium batteries will work for many months.  Once the rechargeable batteries or alkaline batteries drop even slightly in voltage, my mouse begins to perform poorly.  These lithium batteries seem to hold peak voltage almost to the end of life.
These are the 6x lithium ion batteries, not the 9x ones.The unit price is much better than I see in stores and these batteries really last a long time.  I use them in my green laser pointer because they last so much longer than regular alkaline batteries.  The higher price is more than offset by the long life.  Buying them on Amazon makes them an even better deal.
I only use 2 brands of batteries Ultimate Lithium in my life/critical devices and duracell ultra in everything else.  The lithiums do last longer in and also preservation.  Great price on these from amazon, can't go wrong for smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, camera flashes, and battery powered weather stations.  For everything else and toys Duracell Ultra is your friend.  So as you see i like both and recommend both.
These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive, they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls, mice or smoke detectors.
I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1,5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use.
I love using these batteries. Very powerful and like lithiums provide full voltage and power til the very end - not like alkaline that gradually loose power and voltage over time.A super battery and reliable.
No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago.
After trying anther more expensive bottle brush that had a weak handle that made it hard to clean with, I was very pleased to find this one does not have that problem.  It is about a foot long, with a nice rubber grip and a very strong handle and quality construction, Soft bristles that clean well.  Overall very good and a great value.
I put tea in my metal water bottles and the residue builds up rapidly.  Just rinsing doesn&#8217;t help and I decided I&#8217;d purchase the OXO bottle brush.  With a quick whirl around the inside of the bottle, it swiped that tea residue out in a second.  I was very pleased and tried it on several other things that needed a bit of cleaning.  I simply left the brush to soak after I was done and it still looks like new.FEATURES:&#9658;  Durable neck flexes for easy reach inside bottles, pitchers and carafes&#9658;  Ideal for sauce jars, baby bottles, vases and tall glasses&#9658;  Stiffer bristles clean hard-to-reach corners&#9658;  Safe for crystal and stemware&#9658; Tackles multiple tasks with two types of bristles&#9658; Flexible neck makes getting into hard spots easy&#9658;  Rounded head is perfect fit for bottles and narrow jars&#9658;  Nonslip handle, wet or dry&#9658;  Perfect for gentle cleaning or vigorous scrubbing&#9658;  Dishwasher safeI even tried using it in the dish drainer for those hard to reach corners that always seem to have a little grimy buildup.  Worked like a charm, but it did soil the brush a bit.  I simply put a bit of bleach in some sudsy water and it immediately came clean.  Then I rinsed it well and dried it.  I was expecting a stiff brush, but instead got one that was soft, but just stiff enough to do those tricky jobs.  Really pleased with this purchase.
Looks good, especially the exuberant looking bristles at the business end. I use this with Aqua Sana glass water bottles and it's perfect. Gets every bit of the interior clean with soapy water. The handle is typically Oxo quality, it's a work of art as well as a bottle brush. Think back to old, mean-spirited, lifeless bottle brushes you used. Now look at this. Oxo GETS IT. A good tool you feel positively about it worth the effort, you know?
I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have, not one has failed and each has performed as advertised, but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily, the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one.
I use this brush to clean narrow-necked, glass bottles; stainless-steel, sports water bottles; glass carafes; and 16-ounce, tall, water glasses that are too narrow for my hand to fit inside.This has a really nice rubber grip. The bristles are firm enough to clean well, but not so hard they aren't flexible.Highly recommended!
Sometimes you just need something simple.This brush is perfect for cleaning many sorts of travel cups, thermoses, bottles, vases, and other various hand-wash dishes such as little spoons. Since I've collected the spoons from around the world, I want to keep them in good shape. The OXO brush is much nicer on the spoons than the dishwasher, and the multiple angles of the bristles make it very easy to clean smaller items.I have also used the brush on hand-wash cups because it is so easy to use. The flexible stem and bunches of bristles means it almost cleans the dish itself (with soap).That said, I use it as a secondary brush most of the time, once I've scraped off any visible marks. Although the bristles are good, they are not real strong. I don't think it would scrape off dried dough, for instance.Considering the price, it may be worth it to just stock my sink with several of the OXO brushes, one for every occasion.I haven't washed the brush in the dishwasher yet, I'll let you know the results when I do.
We are using this for baby bottle brush. The bristles are just perfect in stiffness. It is easy to use as it slides smoothly in and out of  the bottle. From what I read from other reviews, this brush is also great on Nalgene water bottles.  The handle is made of rubber and very comfortable.  It is a little long compared to other brush bottles we tried before but that doesn't pose a problem at all.Overall, it is a well made brush.
I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new, I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush, it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!
My wife's Nalgene bottle has that narrow opening that's impossible to clean without this brush. The brush itself has some great firm bristles, and the stem has some slight flexibility, but will stay firm and doesn't seem it'll break unless you're deliberately trying.We also have the baby bottle brush from OXO that we plan on using for bottles, so if it's anything like this bottle brush, I know it'll work splendidly.
I have been buying these kind of brushes for years.  This is the reason I don't mind washing my dishes by hand.  I used to hate using a dish cloth and getting hands wet. I change them about every 3 months.
It suits the purpose of all my glass bottles, for juicing and glass drinking bottles!  The handle is bendy to allow you to work around the whole inside.  I just love it, as I was a little skeptical if it would fit some of my narrow drinking bottles, ended ups fretted more than I needed to.  Love it for the price point too!
This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches, and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long, which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle, which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible, and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker, which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made, and cleans effectively.
I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer, re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so, and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation.
These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.
Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each, this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target, Walmart, etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh, lemony, sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each, which helps to increase the value and lower the cost.
Those of us who shave have to "face" it.... shavers and razors all have repeated costs.  A normal razor requires new blades, shaving cream, and after-shave (sometimes pre-shave).  People have gotten used to the idea that electric shavers should have fewer consumables (especially given the cost).  However, electric shavers have greatly improved in recent years, and the new Brauns are about the greatest shavers on the market today.  Part of the way they achieve such a close cut is that they do not "gunk up" with skin cells and oil the way other shavers do.  I guess you could clean another shaver daily, but the Clean and Renew is about the best way I have seen to maintain a consistently close shave.  I accept the monthly cost of these cartridges the way one would buy shaving cream, shampoo, or any other toiletry.  They do a nice job and smell quite pleasant.  Only issue is that the smell is not designed to go right on your face.  If you remove the shaver mid-cycle and try to use it, it is not a pleasant experience.  But one the liquid dries, the shaver has a pleasant aroma.  Recommended!
My husband loves this razor.  He bought the first refills for it from Rite Aid for $7 and change each plus tax, without asking me to shop around for him (sigh).  Amazon runs them three for $12.99 including super saver shipping.  I looked around and can't find them any cheaper than this.  If someone else can, I wish they would let me know.
My husband has had his Braun razor for about three years, and I have been ordering these cartridges for him that entire time.  He usually runs the cleaning cycle after every use and shaves about five times a week, but these still last a really long time for him.The new frustration-free packaging is also nice and helps cuts down on waste.Yes, these are pricey, but they do an excellent job of keeping his shaver clean and fuzz-free.
I have owned the  Braun Syncro for over two years now and I still love it as much as the day I bought it. The Clean & Renew cartridges are wonderfully convenient as they both clean and lubricate the shaver head in one step (the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger over the shaver head after each cleaning). The cleaning also leaves a fresh lemon scent.Now, the convenience comes at a price. The price of the Clean & Renew cartridges is definitely a concern for a lot of people, including myself. There are, however, a few things you can do to economize:(1) remove the cartridge and cap it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile alcohol component, or (2) if that's too much of a hassle, top of the cartridge with 91-99% isopropyl alcohol when the fluid runs low. (3) don't run the shaver through the cleaning cycle after *every* shave; do it only after several shaves (note: Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF). (4) if you're really strapped for cash, you always have the option of cleaning the shaver head under running tap water! Just remember to lube the shaver head periodically with amachine oil.I absolute love these Clean & Renew cartridges! They will help to keep your Braun Synchro at its optimal performance to give you a shave that's just about as close as one you get from a blade!
I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that).
If you search around, you can find the best price when you buy these in bulk. These work great with the Braun Shaver system... and you've got to have them... so buy a pack at the best price! I found them on Amazon at different prices (and the best price was here with free shipping and no tax)... but I've also found them elsewhere on the web for less at other times... check before you buy!
New shaver any time you want. Great stuff. Smells good. Cheap and fast ship from Amazon. Well done Braun!
I hate having to buy these, because you are essentially paying for a piece of filter material and some alcohol. Still, once your shaver goes through the cleaning cycle, it comes out feeling brand new, and shaves like new as well. The liquid contains a lemon scent and some lubricant for the razor, and the end result is almost worth the high price.To get a better deal, use the Amazon subscribe and save option, I get mine shipped every 6 months, and save 15%.
I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard, and sometimes I shave in the shower, so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time, but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also, if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week), I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product.
I use the Amazon Subscribe and Save for these Clean & Renew refills. With the S&S; discount, the price is about $3 cheaper per refill than the local stores.In terms of needing these, well, I've yet to take my shaver on a trip of a week or so and not have it tell me to clean it after 4 shaves. This is with running water over the blade and grill.I shave every other day and clean the shaver every time, as long as I'm home. Every time I pick it up, at home, it does as good a job as it did when I first bought it. When I travel and don't clean it so the light goes out, the shave takes much longer and isn't as close.So you save money in the long run going electric, until they figure out ways to ensure you still have to buy something from them, much the way the replaceable blade shavers do. If you can get over that and want to have a close shave, as close as it can get to the brand new feeling, then purchase these. I recommend the subscribe and save option as well, and just put it on a 6 month schedule. That's how mine is set and using the clean function every shave (every other day), the cartridges seem to last about 6 weeks or more.
First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily, you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks
I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But, it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol, although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full, i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However, at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks.
I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far, I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip, I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham
My boyfriend prefers this razor model over the newer ones that have four blades.  He says this is definitely the one to use and I was happy to find a deal on the replacement cartridges.  His face is always smooth and kissable and I've never seen him nick himself which has happened with other razors.  Overall a great price for the replacement cartridges.
This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No, I don't live with Grizzy Adams, but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really, no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job, but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly, highly recommend!
I'm still buying these year after year instead of upgrading to the latest and greatest and more expensive. They just work really well.
My husband has a thick, dark beard and dainty, sensitive pale skin. These blades work well and don't irritate his skin. No five o'clock shadow; no razor burn. Using blades instead of disposables saves plastic and you get to hold a nice metal handle.Perfect, huh?Well, a straight razor is more green--it's forever if you just sharpen it, but he's not going there.
We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s, and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks, even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years, and always come back to Mach 3.
I'm an older guy with a very tough beard. When I was just beginning to shave (about 48 years ago) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor.  It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3's ever since they came out. They do the job for me better than anything else I've tried, so I've stuck with them. I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades, send them back for a refund. Or better yet, contact Gillette and let them know what you received.  Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you.
I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest "Shaving Tips From Gillette".
Paid $10 on a Gold Box sale.  Definitely a good price for these lades.  I usually pay $6-8 for a pack of 4 at the grocery store/pharmacy.These are decent blades, and I like them much more than Schick blades.  They clean easily, are sharp, and last a long while.  In my option, the best all-around blades on the market.
Since I don't eat powerbars to achieve the advantages of being energized before a workout, I chose them purely as a snack.  Unlike the usual powerbar hardened feel, this is unique soft chew, and it looks like a drinkable smoothie.Fruit Smoothie Energize has a strong berry aroma upon opening the package.  The bar is with 210 calories and 30 calories from Fat.  It is filled with 17...count 'em...17 vitamins and minerals.  The product claims no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.I like the taste for a quick pick me up...Now I am energized for the day, or maybe for just for the ride home from work.....Rizzo
A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go...... who always has time for a sit down breakfast? ... Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD !
i really liked this bar.  i am not a big fan of these kinds of bars because they always tasted like a vitamin to me.  this one had great flavor and i did feel like it was a mid afternoon pick me up !  it was easy to eat and can be eaten on the run.i would highly recommend this
Finally a power bar that doesn't taste like cardboard.  I was leery when I got this bar but it really is very good.  The taste is fantastic.
I've been a fan of PowerBar since 1996 when I was pregnant with my oldest child. I used the bars as snacks when I had to be at the University for college classes all day.  I came to know "the PowerBar aftertaste".  I used the bars again as nutritional supplements during two subsequent pregnancies.  Some slight differences but still that aftertaste.I am happy to report that the PowerBar Energize Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie bar has no aftertaste. It isn't too sweet. It isn't gritty.  It's actually very good.It's nice to see how PowerBar has grown up.  The nutritional values have increased, the taste is better. I would actually consider using this as a  meal replacement or healthy snack a few times a week.
This Power Bar has a very natural, fruity flavor.  I was impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and plenty of protein in addition to energy is included.  With only 30 out of 210 calories from fat, it has an excellent nutrient balance with only a drop of added vegetable(canola) oil.  My only suggestion would be to make this more grainy and less gummy.  It is so gummy that you have to be careful not to choke on it!  Chew well.
The Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie PowerBar provides all the energy sustaining vitamins and minerals which one might expect from an energy bar, and it has a satisfying, mildly fruity flavor without being too sweet.This 210 calorie bar will carry you through any rigorous workout whether you're exercising at the gym, or you're landscaping out in yard, this power bar is a tasty way to keep from suffering the dizzying effects of nutrient deficiency while performing demanding tasks.An excellent pick-me-up, Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie is a delicious way to keep going!
Let's be perfectly honest, PowerBars are not haute cuisine.  After running a 10K, climbing a mountain, spending the day hiking through Alaska's backwoods, who among us would prefer to gnosh on a PowerBar to a soft, flaky chocolate-filled croissant?Um, not a soul!That being said, if you are one of those super-fit, watch-what-you-eat sorts (or you just can't find a way to fit those crumbly croissants into your backpack), the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie Berry Blast is super good.  I shared half of mine with my husband (who is, incidentally, a devout devourer of the PowerBar), and he practically declared it mana from the Gods.He said, "This is the best of all the PowerBars...far better than the berry bar and far, far superior to the peanut butter chocolate bar."I thought this bar was smoother than other PowerBars and had a lot more flavor.  The berry taste is intense and stays with you, though it does not leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  The serving size is the same as other PowerBars, so you really get what you pay for.  All in all, a very good product.
This bar is great...like a thick and creamy smoothie I make at home but without the mess.  The berries are there but with all of the vitamins.  Vitamin's A, C, Calcium, and tons more.  And you can't even taste them.  I was so surprised that it tastes like a candy bar, one of those that I get from the nutrition area at the grocery store.  It says energize and I guess it does but what it did was keep me from being hungry betweem lunch and a late dinner.  The calories are 210 for the whole bar and the fat grams are 3.5...an acceptable number for a snack in the middle of the day.I'm keeping one in my purse now.  I thought about keeping one in the car and although it doesn't have a bit of chocolate in it I believe it would melt.  The grandkids liked them too.  It's a way of them getting the vitamins they need that they don't get in that junk food they love so much.I would recommend this product.
This is a very delicious bar. It doesn't have that weird, dusty taste that so many nutrition bars have, it's chewy and, to coin a phrase, it's satisfying.If I had to fault it at all, I would say that its sweetness is quite intense. That's an easy fix, though: Don't eat it all at once. Take your time and nibble at it over a 30-minute period.It's high in carbs but not in calories so it's a good choice of nutrition right before a hard work task or exercise routine. It's crammed with vitamins, too, more than most bars.As a martial arts teacher and weight trainer, I highly recommend this one.
These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.
Five SUCCESSFUL Stars!! PowerBar Fruit Smoothie Berry Blast is a winner. Boasting 210 calories, 3.5 grams of total fat with no trans fat, zero cholesterol, 180 mg of sodium, 35 mg of potassium, 42 Carbs, and 24 grams of sugar, it's loaded for a quick fix energy spike or to replace a skipped meal. Beyond that, it has 17 vitamins and minerals with 10 providing a whopping 100 % of the RDA (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamins B6 and B12, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Folate, Biotin, and Niacin, among them): energy and nutrition!! Proof? Yesterday I ate a bar to replace a missed meal before an important meeting: entirely unplanned, not as an acid test of the product. I was in a jam and I ate the bar, chased it with water,  and drove to my meeting. The result was that at a time of the day when I'm normally losing energy, I was alert, energized, and had no growling stomach from missing lunch. And there was no 'crash' afterwards. As far as I'm concerned, this powerbar is a WINNER and the berry blast fruit smoothie flavor is very tasty. BTW I bought one at WalGreens the other day. My Highest Recommendation. Five IMPRESSIVE Stars!!
. . . what this is . . . a good tasting, portable/storable shot of 210 calories fortified with a variety of minerals and vitamins (substantial vits B, C, E, as well as a wide list of minerals).Filling.  A taffy-like consistency with a grittiness akin to ground up berry seeds (whether authentic or just for effect, I do not know). Pleasant berry-like flavor.  Very low fat (no trans-fats), low sodium. 24 grams of sugar.I am not a big fan of energy bars and their often medicine-like taste.  I like this one.  Seems to be a good choice for lunch boxes, trunk of the car, backpacks or emergency kits.
Gentlemen, let me give you a some free information. The average woman is a little shorter than the average man (about 6 inches I have read), so that means that all too often we find ourselves looking up your noses. And, if there is one thing that turns many of us off, it is the sight of all sorts of hair streaming out of your nostrils! (How do some of you guys breathe?)Anyway, I highly recommend this excellent groomer, which does an excellent job of getting rid of that unsightly nose and ear hair. It doesn't pinch or pull, and is very easy to use. I got one for the guy in my life about a year ago, and am very happy with the results. Take my advice, gentlemen, and get grooming!(Review of Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer)
Well-designed tool that works so much better than "safety" manicure scissors. Really keeps things tidy. I wish that everything in the world was this well-designed. This would also make a nice little stocking stuffing for the holidays, something small but thoughtful.Face the fact that you just don't *need* hair growing out of your ears or nostrils. Comes with age, but it's gross. This is EASILY the best way to keep yourself nice and neat!
This gadget is great, it cuts close and does the job efficiently and quietly with no cuts or pain.  Do not try it for purposes other than grooming nose or ear hair.  Ugh!  And if someone gives this to you as a gift in front of a crowd of people, this person is not your friend, but even so, look in that mirror and if you need it, use it, do us all a favor and yourself most of all.  This gadget does a much better job than scissors or other little shavers.  This is state of the art.  I am not a sasquatch so a battery lasts months for me.Update January 2006- I am seeing a basic conflict in reviews posted after mine.  Perhaps Panasonic has made its product cheaper.  I haven't had any trouble at all with my unit.  It works first time, every time, and I have only changed the AA battery Once since I have owned the machine.  It does not hurt when the hairs are cut.  It cuts the hair down, it does not pull it out.  There may be a spate of defective products out there.  I would suggest buying it at a place where there is a warranty in force.  How about Sears where everything is guaranteed or your money refunded?
I had bought a low quality grommer from a different manufacturer a couple of months back and suffered from it - it would take me atleast 10 mins of grinding around my nostrils to remove all the hair follicles and even after that, I could still feel some hair inside - which I hate.Disappointed with my earlier experience, I took my chance with this one - there are some negative reviews and some strong positive reviews.With this one, I am pretty happy with the way it performs - just 2-3 mins and I have a clean feeling in my nostrils and ears.Some of the negative reviews and my comments on it* Too painful and yanks off sensitive hair - yes it does pain - but very very little.  If you want zero pain, somebody needs to design a microprecision tool for this and would cost you nothing less than a grand.* Too irritating - Yes, it is not a comfortable feeling to get something moving at high speed inside your nose and ears, it is just a matter of getting used to* Breaks after a few months/malfunctioning - Well, I have some doubts here, if you guys have been immersing the whole thing into soap water and cleaning it.  It is an electrical equipment and does needs some due care.On the other side, these are low margin, low volume business for these companies and I would'nt be surprised if they put low quality parts into manufacturing this.Overall, I am pretty satisfied this product.
These Oral B-Sensitive brush heads are perfect for me. I have sensitive teeth and these brushes are just what the dentist ordered. They have the indicator bristles which signal when it is time to replace the brush head. I like that because my dentist recommends changing your brush every 3 months and in about three months the indicator bristles have changed from blue to white. These are great and the price is cheaper than the grocery store.
I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.
Like these...Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)...we go through them so quick very pricey. But a necessity for us have considered going back to manual ones.
Oral B Sensitive Toothbrush HeadsThe sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine. In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles. These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn't feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric brush.Overall: 5/5
The Oral-B sensitive head is great for getting in and around all the tight spaces in your mouth without tearing up your gums.  My dentist is always harping on me to use sensitive brushes to protect my gums.Since I started using these compact heads, my dentist tells me that I have exceptionally clean teeth.  I think this is because the tiny head on these brushes can even get behind my wisdom teeth where a normal, larger headed brush couldn't reach.
I purchased these at the recommendation of my dentist.  I had gum surgery a few years ago, so I try to be careful, and these extra-soft brush heads are extremely gentle while still doing what they need to do.I usually switch to a new brush head every other month, so a package of 3 will last me 6 months.  I use this Oral-B toothbrushOral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary), and this brush head fits fine.I liked these so much I now have them on subscribe and save.
I recently purchase an Oral-B toothbrush. I have been a long-time Sonicare user.I decided to also try these sensitive head brushes besides what came with the toothbrush.  While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.The one thing I miss from my Sonicare brushes is the head cover.  It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when traveling.Other than that they are easy to get on and off and rinse easily.
I replaced the "Floss Action" head on my Smartseries 5000 with this "Sensitive" brush head.  The rotating part is taller, narrower, and much softer than the floss-action-- it feels better on my teeth, more like brushing and a lot less like a mechanical device is giving my teeth a beating.Oral-B brush heads fit most Oral-B toothbrushes, so you can switch between types of head easily.  This one feels more "snug" (harder to pull off) than the Floss Action which came with the brush. Especially if you floss anyway, the sensitive heads are easier on your mouth and seem to work just as well.
I've been using the Oral B electric toothbrushes for about 10 years now and love them.I've tried these all-bristle brushes as well as the Floss Action brushes with the plastic gum massagers.Both types of brushes work great.  I recommend trying both and seeing which you prefer.  For me, I feel like the all-bristle brushes give a more focused cleaning.  I'm a religious flosser so I get plenty of gum stimulation.I also tried some generic brushes at one point, but the didn't seem to work as well.  They seemed to have more internal friction which made the head move slower.I highly recommend these brushes.
I've been using this toothbrush head for weeks, because one came with my Oral-B 3000 Professional Care electric toothbrush. When I received the toothbrush, I wasn't totally happy to see a smaller, round toothbrush head instead of the oval shape I've used all my life in both manual and electric toothbrushes. Now I like the round head more. It does take longer to brush my teeth, but because this is an electric toothbrush, not much longer. I need to brush more mindfully, checking the mirror as well as I can to make sure I hit all of each tooth with this little brush head. Unless I am careful to keep the brush on my teeth and away from all my soft tissues, I bleed a little. (My gums are fine, I don't bleed when I floss.) I don't know whether this is because of the head, or the toothbrush's strong motor. All this took practice, but I've managed it. Now the small head seems even more effective, because I can more easily clean my molars, especially on the inside. My mouth feels even cleaner than it did after I used my old electric toothbrush with an oval head.
Excellent product. Teeth definitely felt cleaner after using. Felt like you've just left the dentist office after using or close to it cause you get that clean feeling. I Would use these brushes before a regular one or times when you just want to get your teeth/gums extra clean. That's how well they work and they also fit on another model base that I had. Highly recommended.
The Oral-B professional precision clean brush heads work perfectly with my Braun Oral-B Professional 3000 electric toothbrush.  The brush heads are very compact, fit around your mouth easily, and surround your teeth in a cup-like manner.  They don't have any special cleaning / polishing bristles like other Oral-B brush heads, but they clean very well regardless.The packaging is a very simple small cardboard box, that's easy to open.  Inside the box are the four brush heads, each in their own individual package.All in all...a must buy for those who have Oral-B electric toothbrushes.
When I ordered these, I really wasn't sure that they would fit my Braun toothbrush since the brush, to be honest, is about five years old.  But, the replacement head fits perfectly and it was a real pleasure to get the feel of a new brush on my teeth.  In the past when I ordered replacement heads on the internet some turned out to be fakes and I had to throw them out as the brush head came away from the body of the brush.  This DID NOT happen with these replacement brush head and I would definitely recommend purchasing same.
While these brush heads are not my favorites to use with myOral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count, they still do a great job. (For the record, my favorite brush heads are theOral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill. I usually rotate the brush heads I use just to change things up a bit. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I feel like using different heads from time to time is a good idea. In any case, these brush heads are great.
I am a long time user of the Oral-B electric tooth brushes, having used just about every possible brush head type over the years. In general, the bigger and more intricate the brush head, the better the cleaning. This is especially true with these replacement brushes. These somewhat larger heads, with different size bristle lengths, seem to mold and conform to the teeth and gum surfaces for a more precise cleaning action.  And because these heads are bigger than the standard size bushes, the outer rotation of these brushes, with the different size bristles, provide for a more forceful and thorough cleaning action of the teeth and gums.  My teeth feel 'squeaky' clean afterwards.  These Oral-B brushes, and really the entire product line, are second to none when it comes to taking care of your teeth and gums.
I have the Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush. I've tried some of the other heads and find some of them are too large or the bristles too hard for me. (pro white and dual action heads) When I've used these in the past my gums get sore over time. With the precision clean heads I don't have any problem with my gums getting sore. The bristles are firm enough to clean well but soft enough not to cause soreness. They are the right size for my mouth. The larger heads make it more difficult to brush the back molars. These reach all my teeth without any problem. I will continue to use these exclusively.
Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)  These work great .........I'm loving my new Oral Toothbrush I had switched back to manual for a while. My husband said he wanted to switch back also I'm always...amazed at how quick I receive items from Amazon!~
These are staples at my household. Besides from being good replacement brush heads, that leave your teeth squeaky clean, these also come in a cardboard box, instead of a plastic case, which is great.
The Oral-B Precision Clean brush heads are a good, basic, "default" option to choose. They're not too soft, not too hard, but just right. They clean my teeth and gums effectively and last quite well for a nice length of time. This four pack includes different colors (blue, light blue, pink, and yellow), so they can be coded for a family to use. The brush heads feature light blue bristles that will fade away until about the halfway point (about three months), which helps let you know when to change it out for another. These fit a variety of models, the one that I use is theOral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, but double check to make sure these are the right ones for your specific toothbrush. Perhaps a bit pricy but considering the quality of the brush heads compared to generics, they're definitely worth it.
Love Love Oral-B, have been using it for a very long time - the brush heads are generally very expensive but the Amazon price was very reasonable AND as always, saved me that dreaded trip to buy them when they could be shipped to my door. They stick right on top of my Oral B base and I generally use them a month or so before discarding - sometimes less. I think the brush holds itself well for a reasonable time. This particular head is my favorite. I have tried others and haven't liked the feel in my mouth. Will definitely repurchase a next batch when I am out. Awesome work Oral-B!
I think anyone who have branched out and tried the big box store brands know that the original Oral-B replacement heads last a fair bit longer but it is like 20% more expensive at list price. This is mostly because the bristles are somewhat higher quality. However, once we factor the manufacturer's coupon into the equation, it's not clear that the store brand is really any cheaper. As of this writing, Amazon's price is similar to the list price at the local store. In this regard, I think the optimal strategy is pretty clear.However, the packaging Amazon used to send these four replacement heads to me is pretty frustrating. The whole thing come in a padded envelop, and inside is a small box that contains the four heads in their individual packaging. That means it actually uses more packaging than if I get it at a local store (which will use a piece of cardboard and some plastic to contain the four replacement heads). Frankly, they may as well just send the four individually packaged heads in a lightly-padded envelop.I am still giving this product five stars since these are of the highest quality you can get. What holds me back from buying it from Amazon is the way you get it and the fact that the current price is not competitive.Disclaimer: I get this through the generous Amazon Vine program.
I've been using the Oral B from Braun for years and the brushes need replacing on a regular basis for optimal oral care. The brushes come with color-coded rings at the base of each replacement brush for homes where there are more than one user of the rechargeable base. The brush performs as it should. Personally, I favor using the Braun Oral-B instead on manual brushing and I think it does a much better job for me. My dental hygienist always compliments me on my good oral health.Oral-B Professional Model Eb20-4 Precision Clean Replacement Brush Head, 4 Count
I've been using my Oral B toothbrush for, goodness, eight years now, and I love it. These brush heads are my favorite. While some of the other brush heads available have fancy features like gum massaging or "floss action", I have found that I don't want a gum massage and I can floss just fine on my own. I want a straightforward and effective toothbrush head, and I've settled on these as they are functional and effective without having too many bells and whistles to where it ruins the experience. I brush twice a day for the two minutes signaled by the toothbrush, and my heads last about two months before they look ready to be replaced.
If you are new to the world of Oral B brush heads, these specific ones are designed to help with gum line issues.  In terms of the bristle, I would definitely put them in the "medium" category.  They are not as harsh as the Floss Action heads, but not as soft as the Sensitive heads.  I would consider these to be a good starter head (though I also recommend the Floss Action if you are too lazy to floss yourself).There is a blue indicator on the head- when it goes down to about halfway, you are supposed to change out the head.  Oral B recommends this every 3 months but I can make it every 4 months on mine (with twice a day brushing).I used to brush with Sonic Care but multiple dentists have told me that the Oral B brushes are better.  They definitely work as my dentist didn't yell at me (for once) at my last cleaning.
These brush heads are great.  I love the frustration free packaging they came in too.  The difference between these and an ordinary brush head is that there are longer, coarser bristles on the outsides that line up perfectly with your gum line.  In a very short amount of time I have noticed less plaque build-up along the gum line, and my gums have gotten a lighter shade of pink.  They look healthier to me.Great brush heads!  Just make sure they'll fit your model of toothbrush and you're good to go!
These replacement heads are perfect, the same as the original. They brush the teeth and gums very well, much better than a manual brush. I tried generic replacement brushes but those are not the same. They wobble, shake, and sometimes fly off while in use.  I will now stick with the genuine brushes!
These brush heads provides precision cleaning exactly as their name suggest. I have been using them since last 3 years and can't move on to anything else. Being a small brush head it has a very good reach inside the mouth and on the inner side of teeth, especially the lower end corners which tend to accumulate most food particles. They fitOral-B Vitality Pro White Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Countand have a very good life. These are better thanOral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)since Dual Clean can't reach to the inner side of teeth due to their weird shape and size.Overall, this product is highly recommended.
As far as I can tell, these brushes are genuine Oral-B brushes.  I mention that because I was sold counterfeit brushes by a seller on Amazon; every brush literally fell apart in my mouth!  I'm lucky I didn't chip a tooth or swallow that little screw.  I will only buy these directly through Amazon or in a reputable store from now on.If you have sensitive teeth/gums, these bristles may be a little stiff/painful for you.  My mom finds these too much for her so she buys the sensitive bristle brushes.Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)Personally, I don't have any gum or sensitivity issues so these "Precision" brushes work well for me.I have this model:Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count
I ordered these brush heads to replace the Floss Action head that came on myOral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. The Precision Clean is working very well. It fits on the brush perfectly and functions just like the original. It certainly feels like it's doing an excellent job of getting my teeth clean. As far as I tell from descriptions, this is designed as the "all-around" replacement head - not flossing, sensitive, whitening, etc. The bristles look and feel like ones on a regular manual brush. I like the indicator bristles that lose color over time and remind me to replace the brush head (every three months or so.) Truthfully, I don't have a preference between this style of brush head and the flossing action; both do a great job as far as I can tell.
My dental hygienist recommends replacing the brush heads on an electric toothbrush at least once every six months.  It was getting expensive, buying brush head replacements at a local drugstore, so I checked Amazon and was happy to find these reasonably priced ones.  They fit my Braun Oral-B "3D Action Plaque Remover" model, and they also fit my husband's Braun Oral-B "Professional Care" model.Over a couple of years, neither of us have had a single problem with these brush heads.  We replace them when the blue indicator bristles signal that the brush head needs replacing (when the bristles have turned to half-white, half-blue).  This is usually about 5-6 months after the brush head is installed.When you order these ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL PRECISION CLEAN replacement brush heads, you get a tall, slender, sealed retail package with the Oral-B brand on it.  The package contains 4 replacement brush heads.
I have been using several models of an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush for four years and have replaced the heads many times. Out of the many different heads available, the Precision Clean is definitely my favorite -- it has the most bristles and is slightly on the soft side. The bristle color changes clearly indicate when it is time to replace the brush and the manufacturer recommends replacing it at least every three months. Obviously, we all have different brushing styles and you may have to replace yours more often. I tend to push the edge a little because of the one major problems with any replaceable head is the price. I have not seen the bristles fall apart or the brushes become defective in any other way, however. They always fit any of the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes I have had over the years, so I have not had to worry about the brushes being incompatible with newer models. In any case, my mouth always feels refreshed after using these heads and I have no hesitation in recommending them.Rarely do the heads go on sale and my best advice is to buy the larger quantity packaging (and/or Subscribe and Save) for additional savings -- which you can usually find at a local warehouse club as well...
I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for over ten years.  It was recommended by my dentist.  Both he and I are happy with the results.One of the problems that I have encountered over the years is that of finding replacement heads.  It can cost as much for the replacements over the course of one year as the original price of the toothbrush.  This is the ink jet printer business model.  They make their profit on the supplies and not the original purchase.It is not so easy to find quality brush head refills for the electric toothbrush. I have been using the precision clean brushes.  I cannot tell which are the high-quality products even looking at them in the local stores. Price is not necessarily a good indication.  I have bought expensive refills which have performed badly.I have found that the solution to the problem lies in the collective experience of Amazon reviewers. Of course, you can order the replacements and then judge the quality of the product. However, once I realized it, all that I had to do was look for the product having a large number of recent five-star reviews. Then it would be safe to place an order.The reviewers found the replacements at this site to be of high quality.  I did also. They work well and are of good quality.  This is a good example of crowdsourcing.
Not a lot to criticize here. We've been Oral-B users for a long time. These brush heads clean well and work as well as our previous. It's not clear to us that the extra little cleaning features make a huge difference to us vs. the legacy plain-Jane brush heads we've had, but they do work at least as well.We like these and would buy them opportunistically based on price.
I have recently puchased a new Oral-B electric toothbrush.  It is used by two people in my household.  There is only one brush and we change head prior to using it.  Since dentists recommend replacing toothbrush every three months, this supply of four heads can be a six month supply for two people.  If multiple people in your household are using the same electical toothbrush base, you will not mix up the heads.  Each head has its unique color, so every person will know exactly which toothbrush head belongs to what individual. I have been using electrical toothbrushes for years, because I find them superior to the regular (manual) tothbrush.  They also come in convenience containers that are useful for both home and travel.  This particular head will not fit the following brands: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic and Cross Action Power brands.  It will work with all other brands.  Precision clean brush is small and round.  The center of the brush is made of different material that the outlines of the brush.  Bristles are made to change color when brush is used over certain period of time.  In general, I replace brushes once the light blue outside bristle changes its color to white half way through.  This particular brand also offers additional brush models: Floss Action, ProWhite, Sensitive Gum Care and Dual Clean.  In my opinion, they are all good and if you are adventurous, you can change brush types every three months.  The fact remains that these brushes have superior teeth cleaning power that will keep your gums and teeth clean and helathy.  Do not forget to continue to floss and use mouthwash!One important information I was not aware of is that these brush heads are made in Germany, since Braun is a German company.  This is one of the greatest US imports for personal hygene that I can think of.
First a little background, I have been using an Oral-B/Braun electric toothbrush since 1987, I orginally bought one because I thought it would be easier to get my then 2 year old son to brush his teeth, of course being a typical 2 year old, he wanted nothing to do with it.Since it was quite an investment at the time, I started using the Braun toothbrush myself.Fast forward 25 years, and I am still a commited Oral-B/Braun toothbrush user.I have been using this model of replacement brush for the past 3 months, and just had my annual dental exam, at the rather ripe old age of 54, my gums are healthy enough, that the dentist was compelled to comment on how healthy my gums are.Considering that I am over 15 years older than my mother was when she had to have surgery for gum disease, I am very grateful for the sequence of events that led me to start brushing with an Oral-B/Braun toothbrush.These heads are slightly softer than the ones I was using previously, but I like the way the bristles mold to the teeth to get them cleaner. About two months of brushing 3 times a day and the indicator bristles (used to show wear on the brush head) are about 1/2 way down on the blue color used to show wear.It's not just a toothbrush that is needed for complete oral care, even the best electric toothbrush and the best replacement head will not omit the need to floss.Your milage may vary, but my dental routine includes using a whitening prerinse, brush with Aquafresh toothpaste, floss, then brush again for the best results.If your mouth is not used to a more robust daily cleaning, you can expect some soreness and bleeding of the gums, this is not something to panic about, unhealthy gums are weak and it takes time for them to heal from that weakness.The only toothpaste that I can personally recommend is Aquafresh, it is one of the few that my long-time dentist is willing to recommend, as he evaluates toothpastes based on several factors and rejects several popular brands as either having ingredients that can cause allergy problems or are too abrasive to the teethSummation, I recommend these brush heads
We have been using these replacement brushes for years and years.  We love how these replacement brush heads can fit on all the models of toothbrushes Oral-B makes.  That really is convenient if you have more than one model being used in your house by different people.  There are a few types out there and these are our favorite.  It really is a personally preference so trying out the different types for yourself is a good idea.  These are also better than the "flossing action" brush if you have veneers, as those can put a chip in them.Watch out for the fake Oral-B replacement brush heads.  We bought one once at a much lower cost and the packaging really does look genuine, but in a short time we noticed they were not quite as good as the genuine product.  These brushes are a bit pricy, but considering how clean they can get your teeth, they are worth it.
Wow, my husband and I both tried these out and we both agree they are the best replacement heads for the Oral B. They seem to stimulate at the gumline and leave our teeth feeling very clean.  Even though we both have sensitive gums and some recession, these brushes do not hurt or irritate at all and seem to really clean well. They seem firmer than the other brushes yet gentle and soft at the same time. The price is comparable to the other replacement brushes that we have bought, and I assume these will last the same length of time - -for me, the brushes generally last 3 months, but for hubby he goes through them twice as fast.  We have bought our replacement heads on subscribe and save in the past to save a bit and will do the same with these.
Surely, it won't be long after purchasing an Oral-B toothbrush that it will be time to buy some replacement brush heads.I have been using one of the lower tier Oral-B models for two years now, and I love it.  It's made in Germany, and it works fantastic.  I tend to change out my brush heads approximately every forty-five days.  I do not mind the slightly extra expense to know I am using a fresh brush head.These Precision Clean brush heads are my favorite.  I would call them the go to default for your Oral-B brush.  They will give you the traditional, complete, solid clean, you likely desire.  The round, relatively simple looking brush head is actually quite advanced and works with the oscillating nature of your toothbrush.  You truly feel both your teeth and gums are healthier with the use of the brush and these brush heads.  It's a great feeling after every brush.  There are some color changing indicators on the side of the brush to help you guage how worn they are, but again, I change mine out early.Finally, it is important to use genuine Oral-B brush heads.  Be careful of copycats and generics, but even fakes that try to use the Oral-B branding.  These particular brushes are genuine.  Sure, they cost a few dollars more than generics, but they are much more reliable with much less risk of them breaking apart while brushing.  Furthermore, Amazon offers a solid price and at home delivery.  I would recommend you buy your brush heads direct from "Sold by Amazon," and not from third party sellers, just in case.Highly recommended genuine Oral-B product!
I cannot decide wither or not the Floss Action heads or this Precision Clean head is better.  I definitely think they both clean your teeth really really well if done for the 2 minutes you are supposed to brush for.  the Floss Action heads seem to stimulate your gums more while the Precision Clean heads seem to have a more delicate action.  I think it is worthwhile to try both out to see which you prefer.  I use and like them both!
My wife and I have a pair of ancient Braun Oral-B toothbrush (Type: 4729) that we got from Costco.  I was initially kind of scared ordering these as I wasn't sure the heads would fit.  However, the new heads fit perfectly.In an age where changing form factors is a way companies like to pad their bottom lines by forcing you to buy whole new accessories for the next hot model (Curse you Apple and the new iPhone!  I liked my old charger cables and case.) it's really nice to see a company that leaves in the backwards compatibility.  That kind of benefit and the fact the brushes are still running after years of frequent use are two reasons we've stuck with the brand and will in the future when ours eventually break.Anyway, these are the sort of basic head.  You can also get ones that work more like a toothpick with a very narrow brush and ones with plastic bits on it that are supposed to clean gums better.  I always go back and forth between these and the gum ones.  The brush is perfectly shaped to move well at the gum line and my dentist has told me that based on the clinical studies the only mechanical toothbrushes that actually do any good are the circular ones like these.  They actually do a better job of brushing.  There are also colored rings so if you share you will not use another person's head by mistake.The heads will last you between three and six months each and have the seemingly ubiquitous blue color that wears away so you know when to change them.  Since the brush itself will likely last you years like ours have, the brush heads come out to being the price of a really nice toothbrush.  I can't say for sure if they're worth it to you, but they feel really good, work really well, and are a small convenience that we enjoy a great deal.
Not scented, works wonders. You can either spray or stream from the bottle.There are a LOT of "spot cleaners" on the market that don't do a whole lot. I used to use "Hot Shot", but only when I had to, as the smells were awful!This stuff is awesome! Cleans up pet accidents too (My kitty had hair balls that smelled awful & this stuff gets rid of it! No stains, no smells, not a "cover it up" smelly product either! YAY!!!)If you are sensitive to scented products, it's not a problem with this product, which has very little to no scent at all.No chemical or fake-scent strong smells like many products that seem to try to cover up the smells (& fail) & don't do much at all to take any stains out.This stuff killed the cat hairball smell as well as some soda spilled in the carpet & throw-up too & no smell left at all (works like & may even be, enzyme spray?)Whatever is in this stuff, it works! Takes out everything from dirt tracked in to the worst yuck you can think of on carpet!I am going to buy the pet cleaner for the carpet cleaner I bought (also a Bissell, as I have had 2 Bissell vacuums over the years & they are awesome in comparison to many others! I would have only had 2, as the old one had bags so I upgraded, then my bag-less the gal who was cleaning left it running with the yarn from a rug that unraveled in the beater & it killed the motor - someone that has no clue that when the vacuum sounds different, you need to turn it off & see what's wrong - never learned how to clean a house.)I bought the same one & with this cleaner, a rag & a vacuum, it works as good as those people that sell those horrifically expensive vacuums door to door. The guy came to do his demo after my housekeeper just did her regular vacuuming & seemed a bit shocked when there was almost nothing on their demo pad!Having the right carpet cleaner to use with the right cleaner is key to getting floors clean! Works as well as having carpets professionally cleaned. My carpet is dark anyhow, but brightened right up! WOW! I'll get getting more of this AND more of the 2x cleaner I got before for my carpet cleaner! This stuff works well by itself, and together they work synergistically to get the best you could hope to expect out of a 20 year-old carpet! Looks better than cheap carpet that's 4-5 years old now! Amazing!
I was not sure where to start so I picked some spots left by an urping cat.  It was interesting to watch as I set it to streaming and sprayed it on the spot and around the spot. The instructions say not to overdo it but I do not know what that means. The foam on the spot was immediately brown and the rest stayed white. I did pick it up and the paper towel showed that the stain pretreated worked. Then I thought to use it as a real pretreat and sprayed it on a spot. The foam did it do. I waited five minutes and applied the Spotbot to my surprise it looks like the Spotbot just smeared it around. I am still experimenting with the correct combination. However I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I have off-white carpet with several spots that I have been unable to remove with other carpet spot cleaners.  I used the Bissell and it really did a nice job in cleaning those areas.  I certainly would recommend it and I will keep using to help maintain my carpets.
This works great!! You spray on the stain and you immediately see it going to work! New stains it wipes out right away.. A older stain takes a few cleans.. Great stuff!! :)
I've been using this for the occasional stain on my carpets and it works very well. I have a rug shampooer, but I have not had to use it when using this. In fact, I think this works even better than my old machine. The bottle is also a nice size for the price and will probably last me a long time. Good product!
we put this pre-treat to work as soon as it arrived at the front door. We have two wing back chairs that, unfortunately, two dogs like to use when we are not home; we were hoping to restore some of the color back. As a pre-treat, this little sprayer did quite the number of some of the tougher areas without affecting the fabric. After a thorough cleaning, the chairs look as good as new.The pretreater also has a pleasant, clean smell.
I wish the main ingredients were listed on the back, but if I had to guess it would be something along the lines of an OxiClean chemical mix which works great on organic stains and protects the original died colors. In my tests - following the instructions - I sprayed and let rest for about 5 minutes. At first without doing anything it didn't really have an impact on the dark brown splotches on the carpet... but with about 5 seconds of blotting and rubbing the carpet the stains disappeared. These were stains that I had previously tried to get rid of with soap and hot water to little effect. It does have a fairly strong perfume odor, but I found it dissipated rather quickly.
Over the years we have accumulated our share of stains on furniture and carpets that just did not seem to come out with other stain removal or cleaning products.  Some had been in place for years and I really wouldn't have held it against the product if it were not able to remove it given the time lapse.  Much to my surprise, it tackled every one and either removed it completely or as close to completely as one could ever imagine.  The only problem now is that the newly cleaned area looks better than some areas that were never stained in the first place.  Great product!
I just bought a Bissell ProHeat 2X deep steam cleaner a few weeks ago and it came with a bottle of this pre-treat spray for stains.  I had some dark and long-set-in doggie stains that I wasn't sure I'd ever get out.  I used this pre-treat spray and let it set a while (it says 3 minutes, I think, but some of mine were pre-treated an hour or so ahead of time).  When I went through with the steam cleaner, I was amazed to see those stains come up completely.  You can't even tell they were there!I'm definitely buying another bottle pronto!
5 dogs and 4 cats that are well cared for, and have a large yard, but spend most of the time inside makes for the occasional mess. My wife and I have used about every product on the market over the last 20 years and this one is the best. Totally impressed with the effectiveness and quickness. Most products will work with enough repeat treatments but this one works starting on the first pass.Highly recommended!
This is a very good product for loosening-up ground-in dirt in traffic paths for spot cleaning. Spray it on, let it go to work for about 10 minutes, wet the spot a little, and you can even get a lot of it using a wet-vac (although a carpet cleaner with brushing while vacuuming is better.)
There are 3 Sonicare users in our household so, when it comes to ordering replacement brush heads, naturally, we seek the 'family supersize' offer hoping to save a few dollars. As far as I know, this is the largest pack you can get - the 4-pack hasn't been available since almost forever, short of buying them wholesale.Needless to say, but I know I'm preaching to the converted because anyone looking for this item should be a Sonicare user already, 10 years of Sonicare meant lots of money saved in dentist bills and a better quality of life for me. But... you've GOT to replace those brush heads because they DO wear out.Compatible with the following Sonicare models:e3000 - Xtremea4000 - advancee5000 - essencee7000 - elitee9000 - elite
I've got an old Sonicare I love which they don't make original brush heads for.These fit. Long stem reaches into the back of the mouth and small heads allowfor detailed find teeth cleaning.The color fades off gradually to show you when they need to be changed butit's just a gimmick.  I'm sure you can judge for yourself when you need a newbrush head.If you have an older model Sonicare like me look at the bottom of these.If yours requires the type of brushheads that screw on at the bottom thesewill fit.
I am a 30 year old male so I assumed I would only be interested in using the standard sized tooth brushes.  However, I ordered some compact ones thinking my kids could use them.First off, the kids can definitely use the compact ones as they are that small, however, I find I actually like using the compact ones as well.  After brushing with the compact brush I feel the small nooks and crannies of your gums are cleaned better.With that said, I am completely happy with the standard and do use them as well, but I wanted to let people know the compact works great even if you have a larger mouth.
Good price, cheaper than I found at Target.  Comes with two replacement heads.  Was in retail packaging.  Bought from Amazon.com not from an individual seller.  Each head has a plastic brush head cover.Fit my old Essence model (from 2009).  Works well.  Brush heads are what I would call firm.
Sonicare makes the best electronic toothbrush. 75% of that is the brush. If you let the brush do the work, and don't press too hard, each brush will last 6 months, just in time for your dentist to really take you to the cleaners. Expensive? Not really. $25 a year for brushes isn't that much when you consider how much you'll save on a periodontist.Admitted, I've seen the brush go up in price twice in two years, so now I buy six at a time if I find them on "sale."
these heads are to replace the worn out toothbrush head for the e-series sonic care toothbrush.  everyone should have at least a couple extra brush heads on hand.  you forget to replace it and it gets longer down the road and then youn have nothing but nubs left.  if you own a e-series buy a couple extra heads.  they be cheap and they work great.  pop off the old head and pop on the new head.  yes that simple
These replacement heads tend to be pretty expensive in the stores, so I always buy them from Amazon.  Using the subscription service is great because you save 15%, and you get a set reminder of when to change the heads.  The 2-pack is ideal for my wife and I.  Each of the two heads has a different color, so we don't get them mixed up.  The colors vary- so far we've had dark green, light green, blue, and pink (though you don't get to pick your colors when you order).
I have had my Sonicare brushes for about 3 or 4 years. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to normal teeth brushing. When I'm on vacation and don't bring my Sonicare my teeth just feel gross.The key to having a good experience with the Sonicare is changing the brush head about every 6 months. If you wait longer than that the bristles lose their stiffness. Also when you open the head up you find lots of bacteria growing if you wait that long to change the heads. I recommend that each time you change your brush head you disinfect the handle by pouring hydrogen peroxide into the interface. This will protect your new brush head from bacterial build-up.So I recommend you do follow the instructions and get a new one every 6 months. Amazon's subscribe and save sends them to me every 6 months without me even having to remember which makes it all that much easier.
With each head having its own color band we share one base between the two of us.  Just do not knock this off your counter as they will break.  Convenient subscribe and save option so we do not have to remember to change them ourselves.
I love my electric toothbrush and miss it when I am traveling and have to use a traditional brush. These heads are easy to remove and easy to put on-- twist off and twist back on. I like the fact they come in a two pack because it is always good to be one ahead. Dentists recommend changing your toothbrush once a month so a 2 pack would give you a 2 month supply.
I have had my Sonicare Elite now for SIX years! I am so happy that it continues to function great and I replace my brushes about once every 3 months. Since I started using a Sonicare I went from having root canals, to root canal free the last six years- Totally impressed, what a great product! When my Elite finally dies, I will get the updated Sonicare device.Very satisfied!
My local pharmacy charges about the same amount for a single replacement head as Amazon charges for a package of two heads.  It's always a pleasure to save a few bucks by ordering on-line.
I love my Sonicare delete brush. Got it several years ago and have my self on one of the Amazon subscritions to save 15% and get them mailed to me every few months. Great product, great price!
I recently found out, to my delight, that the E-Series brush heads are now compatible with the Sonicare Advance. SWWEEeeeet! I love the E-Series brush head replacements:Features--------- Small Brush Head - Better ReachThe brush head for the E-Series is smaller than that for the A-Series. The small brush head provides a better reach on the back teeth.- Thin Shaft - Less Invasive in the Oral CavityThe shaft of the E-Series is thin and slightly flexible for increased comfort and ease of movement of the brush in your mouth. The E-Series is therefore less invasive and much more friendly to your mouth so it is less likely to trigger gagging.- Wider Brush Strokes = Better CleaningThe angle of sweep of the brush strokes is wider on the E-Series than it is on the A-Series. Each brush stroke on the E-Series thus covers and cleans more teeth area.- Improved Design = Less Gunk BuildupThe improved design of the E-Series helps to reduce the problem of backflow from brush head running down the shaft and seeping into the recessed part of the brush handle that connects to the brush head. (If, like me, you're worried about the buildup of gunk, you can get a silicone skin specially designed for the Sonicare E-Series.)Conclusion----------The E-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line. Be sure to have it replaced at least once every 6 months!
It usually seems like when I order Sonicare replacement bruses on-line that I end up with the small-sized brushes.  These are the full-sized ones which I prefer.  Reasonable price and good replacements, so I am pleased.  RJB.
I have been using these brushes for about 4 years and whenever I go to the dentist for a cleaning they tell me how good of job I am doing.These things work great.
Mrs. Spudman has been using her Sonicare toothbrush for at least four years, and is very pleased with it. Ordering replacement heads from Amazon is very convenient and no more expensive than buying the replacement heads locally. These brush heads are genuine Sonicare and fit her Elite toothbrush. We especially like the frustration free packaging, so much better than those impossible to open hard plastic clamshells.The brushes came in an appropriately sized box and were wrapped in plastic bags.Open the box and slip the brush out of its pliable bag. Nice. No gritting of teeth.We'll order these from Amazon again for sure.
Sonicare says to replace brush heads every 3 months, which can be expensive if you don't shop for price. Costco sells these in the store and also online for less than the price on Amazon.The replacement brush heads work great. Just make sure that you do not overpay.
These are name brand toothbrush heads.  They work great.  They are expensive but they work great and they are far better than the generics.  Worth the price, in my opinion.
We have had the Sonicare Advance for a couple of years now, and been very pleased with how clean and fresh these toothbrushes make our teeth feel! I was disappointed that the A-series heads were discontinued, because I thought I was going to have to buy new brush handles. I am pleased to report that these heads fit just fine on the Advance handles. You might need to get used to the slight angle, and the brush size is slightly smaller, but overall these heads do every bit of the job the old Advance series heads did. Be sure you check out Amazon's subscription offer; not only will it save you money, but you will never forget to replace your brush heads again with auto-shipments as often as you need. I can't think of anything bad to say about these brush heads. If you own Advance handles, try these heads and save yourself the expense of having to buy new handles. Whether you own an Advance or the E series, you'll be pleased with these brush heads!
Having used this for a month, I can say I have been pleasantly surprised. Of course I can not tell for sure it is helping my prostrate, but it has helped my daily restroom visits and, frankly, my libido seems to have been kicked up a bit (no complaints there from anyone in the house).The pills are just the right size and go down easy. No upset stomach at all whenever I have used them. The ingredients seem to be top-notch which is really the main thing you want with any supplement. Anyone can claim anything on their label but is what they claim actually what you are getting. With this I feel I am. Recommended.
New Chapter soft gels for the prostate looks like it has some of the best ingredients to support the prostate. Saw palmetto is well-known for supporting the prostate as well as stinging nettle. I like that New Chapter added ginger, which by the way helps with digestion; pumpkin seeds, which is also good for expelling parasites; green tea, which helps against free radicals; and rosemary, a memory helper and powerful antioxidant. Rosemary also contains substances that prevent the break down of neurotransmitters in the brain, again relating to memory.I am not sure how rosemary and ginger help support the prostate but I can see them fighting free radicals and that may help promote normal cell growth. I know ginger helps with inflammation and so is studied for possible help for arthritis. I also don't know if any of these added ingredients beyond saw palmetto and stinging nettle have sufficient studies backing a normal prostate but it wouldn't hurt to take them. I personally think it helps but one would have to take them on a long term regiment. I am still taking them. I will continue to take them. I look for benefits down the road, not immediately.I like that New Chapter has taken the high road and given quality ingredients for the prostate known at the current time. I personally also take pygeum, zinc and quercetin as an added benefit. So to sum it up, I think New Chapter is on the right track and for such quality ingredients, the price is reasonable. I highly recommend New Chapter prostate formula if going the natural way is for you. It is for me.
well, since I am a girl, I gave these to my hubby who is just starting to have a little prostate problem, waking up at night etc.  He was fully checked by his doctor and the doc said it's just normal aging.I ask himt to try these and after taking the whole bottle, he said he actually feels like it helped him.He isn't waking up at night every single night.  It's not completely gone but he said it is better.Also, he said they are very very easy to take.  He does not like big pills and he also has some stomach issues and he said these did not repeat on him.  Those were little problems he had with other brands.He actually asked me to buy these for him and I am currently trying to find them in a store.  I think I will just order them from Amazon.  You can't beat the customer service here either.Now, I don't know if this has anything to do with the softgels but my husband also said he finds himself with a little more energy.
I have been taking saw palmetto and selenium for years to control the effects of an enlarged prostate.  This formulation has both of them as well as six other ingredients that are claimed to help.  I've only been taking Prostate 5LX for about a week, having stopped the other supplements, but I think I see an improvement.  Trips to the rest room are less often and less urgent.  Time will tell, but all indications are that this supplement is a winner.  At the very least it's convenient to have all of the ingredients in one capsule.
It's very difficult to review vitamins because without a blood test you have no idea if they're really working.  What I can say is that these vitamins are packaged very well, are in an amber bottle to protect the vitamins from light, have no odor, and are relatively small and easy to swallow since they are softgels. The suggested dose is two softgels daily and I've had no problems with upset stomach or any digestive issues.  If you're looking for these ingredients in a vitamin, then you might want to give these a try since they seem well manufactured.
I actually have to finish the whole bottle to be able to come up with a somewhat detailed review for this product. After finishing it, I actually didnt feel anything significant nor was I expecting to feel any difference. But you dont have to "physically" feel anything to know this stuff works. As with any other male, I try to maintain a healthy perspective towards my prostate. As males progress in age, so do the appearance of malaise that afflicts overall body function. The prostate is no exception. Taking this supplement enhances prostate health. I have been reading on the efficacy of the herbal ingredients of this product and they seem to work for what it is intended for. I specifically like what I have read from the benefits of Selenium, palmetto and ginger extracts. These herbal extracts contributes to the overall health and maintenance of your prostate. I like this product to the point of making this part of my supplement intake.
I should have given more thought to asking to review a prostate supplement, but I gave them to a family member who is into this kind of product and he was impressed with the ingredient list. He was using more of a single ingredient supplement and likes the additional ingredients in this product. He recommends it.
If you are a man over 40 then you should be starting to take care of your prostate. I am 52 and have been taking supplements.  These Prostate 5LX by New Chapter should help. You take one with a morning meal and one with an evening meal.  My prostate is OK and I want to keep it that way.
The other prostate remedies out there would work for awhile when my husband first started taking them, but eventually, no matter what he did or took, he'd get the familiar symptoms (especially waking up at night to go to the bathroom).With most natural supplements, it is recommended to give them at least a month to notice an effect.  My husband noticed the difference the first night after taking these New Chapter Prostate capsules.  He was able to sleep through the entire night, for the first time in ages.After ordering this on the Vine Program, this worked so well that I decided to ordering it on Subscribe and Save so my husband will never run out.
This is one of the better prostate formulas in my opinion. The capsules are football shaped and easy to swallow. They don't have any unpleasant side effects like burping, upset stomach, or odd urine smell. The price is a little more than the average prostate health pills at my local drug store, but I think you do get what you pay for with these. I like the potency levels of the ingredients and that you take it twice a day.
I can't make a scientific determination, but it sounds like good stuff and some of it I take separately already. They come in little black gel-type capsules that were easy for me to swallow. The main ingredients are: Saw Palmetto, Green Tea, Stinging Nettle, Ginger, Selenium, Rosemary. If you take these items separately, having them altogether in one product may be more convenient.
My wife loves this thing.  She vacuums and dusts the floor and then mops with the WetJet Spray Mop.  She like household cleaning tools that work well and are light weight.  This to her is very handy and she does not have to ring out a mop, fill buckets with water and dump dirty water.The mop is easy and fast to use and she loves the throw away pad at the end so the cleanup of the mop is easy.  She uses the Swiffer multipurpose cleaner and the pad refills.  She likes any tool that makes her job easier and she loves Swiffer and it does a good job and is fast and easy to use.Our floors are clean and look great!
Swiffer Wet Jet works well on tiles, linoleum, and hard wood floors. The huge downside to it is the cost of replacing the cleaning pads and cleaning solution.However, there is a an alternative to the Swiffer Wet Jet Replacement Pads calledSimplee Cleen Microfiber Refills. These replacement pads are washable and reusable.And if you're willing to put in some elbow grease, there's even a way to refill the cleaning solution bottle (see Refilling The Bottle *).Assembly--------The Swiffer Wet Jet requires some assembly (no tools needed). Once assembled, it cannot be dissembled.The Swiffer Wet Jet requires 4 AA batteries to operate.Functionality-------------The cleaning pads are very absorbent so they pick up even large spills very quickly. The pads also pick up dirt and grime very well when used with the Wet Jet cleaning solution.The bottle containing the Wet Jet cleaning solution is designed to thwart any attempts to refill it. But if you're willing to put in some elbow grease, you can defeat the design and make the bottle refillable. See Refilling the Bottle *.The cleaning head of the Wet Jet can be swiveled from side to side to angle it to clean around corners and hard-to-reach areas.The button to dispense the cleaning solution is conveniently located on the handle.There's a scrubbing strip (replaceable) on the side of the head for tackling stubborn dirt and grime.Durability----------The shaft of the Swiffer is made of aluminum, which makes it very lightweight but strong. The Swiffer Wet Jet is very durable (I've had mine for well over a year).* Refilling The Bottle----------------------There's a way to remove the cap of the Swiffer Wet Jet bottle to refill it with your favorite cleaner. Here's how:- (1) Bring a pot of water to a boil.- (2) Dip the cap (and ONLY the cap) of an EMPTY (used) Swiffer bottle into the hot water. Leave it in for about a minute.- (3) Remove the cap from the hot water and IMMEDIATELY wrap a towel around the cap (to protect your hands from the heat) and twist the cap. It should come right off. Let the cap cool.- (4) There are jagged teeth around the inside of the cap - these are responsible for "catching" the neck of the bottle to prevent the removal of the cap. With a pair of nail clippers, carefully snip these off.- (5) Refill your Swiffer bottle with your favorite cleaner. Note: refilling the bottle with bleach or chemicals that leave a residue will cause the nozzle of the Swiffer Wet Jet to clog over time! Tap water is also a no-no as it leaves behind mineral deposits ("hard water").Conclusion----------The Swiffer Wet Jet is a durable and easy-to-use mop. You can cut the cost of cleaning pads by getting the reusable/washable Simplee Cleen Microfiber Refills. If you follow the instructions on Refilling The Bottle * above, you can even save on the cleaning solution.
It's been a few years now and we still use this on a regular basis.  It's one of the things that has actually held up.  We would buy another after all this time.
It's unclear as to why these are "Professional" batteries. They appear to be comparable in energy storage to standard Duracell alkaline batteries, which are dependable and functional long-lasting energy sources. In any case, the packaging makes this a worthwhile choice as there are no sharp plastic containers that you'll find impossible to open. There's a simple cardboard box holding 6 smaller cardboard boxes, each of which contains 4 batteries. This makes it simple to grab a box of 4 to carry with you as a backup supply for such things as cameras and related equipment. I also find these to be useful for AA-powered wall clocks as it reduces the frequency with which I have to change batteries. Overall, a fine product.
I use these for a wireless microphone.  They do not have a "drop off" other batteries have, so I have full power up to the end.  The even drain makes the wireless mic dependable and predictable.This product has solved many problems.
So far so good I have used about half of the box and they seem to be good the last ones I got most of them where leaking and no good not worth sending back but these are all good so far!
24 pack, 6 packs of 4 each. For an unbelievable price! Check it out, you can't beat it anywhere, so I expect it to be limited.These Duracell batteries seem to last forever. In flameless candles with 5-hour timer, we get about 6 months from them.
These procell batteries are exactly the same technical specs as the regular coppertops.  The only difference is packaging and price.  I, for one, am more than happy to forego the plastic packaging that requires a knife and band-aids to open.  This package contains 6x4 small boxes of batteries.  That is, six boxes of four batteries each.
I went on the Internet to see what is so different about Duracell Procell batteries.  First I learned that they are high energy density with an excellent rate capability.  The operating range goes from -4 degrees F to 140 degrees F with great low temperature performance (think skiing or winter activities) and the shelf life is good up to ten years.  The batteries come in eight (8) sets of four (4) batteries each for convenience.How is it compared to Duracell Coppertop Alkaline batteries?  They are identical - only the packaging is different.  In essence, this package of twenty-four (24) batteries at this price is a steal.  I use batteries mostly for my SCUBA strobe and Video light and four batteries will last a full day of shooting (2 hours plus of video and countless strobe shots).  When depleted, I just dispose of them properly.  Please don't just toss these in the trash.  They can be recycled.
The copper top is one of two brands that never let me down when it comes to batteries. They have a long storage life and a long usage life in electronics. I count on these Duracell Procells when I'm using a high end external flash for my camera. I can go a lot longer before changing batteries w/ these procell batteries. Nice quality.
Having small children I go through batteries like crazy. Amazon has a better price then the box stores so getting them through them is a no-brainer. Duracell has always been my choice of batteries since I've never had one blow or leak. These AA's come in a box and inside there are individual boxes that hold four batteries each. I like that. Not crazy about those plastic packages.
This battery, in my opinion is a bit of a generic despite it's name.  The batteries did work great though and the price at the time was great too.  I would buy these again at the right price, without hesitation.
These are very good battery for the price. THese lasts me much longer than energizer and other brands. They just look better.
Due to various medication taken for herniated back and subsequent surgery my stomach has been giving trouble.  My doctors told me to take Prilosec to protect my stomach from the effects other medications are having on it.  I started taking it last year, and it really helped.Prilosec (omeprazole) belongs to a group of drugs called proton pump inhibitors. Omeprazole decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach. Prilosec is used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other conditions caused by excess stomach acid. It is also used to promote healing of erosive esophagitis (damage to your esophagus caused by stomach acid).Prilosec  should be taken only once every 24 hours for 14 days. It may take up to 4 days for full effect.Last year I bought Prilosec OTC as a regular over the counter drug.  But this year I found that my insurance has a special benefit for this specific medicine. My medical insurance is covering Prilosec OTC with the rate of $5 co-pay for 42 tablets (which is less than a normal co-pay for prescription medicine).  I needed my doctor to write a prescription and specify the OTC packaging of the drug to qualify for the benefit.  This information about this coverage came in the provider's quarterly newsletter and was not well publicized otherwise.  Check with your insurance if you happen to have this coverage as well.
I won't be ordering again because I want plain, unsweetened Prilosec. I got Wildberry Flavor, which is horrible to me. I don't like anything that is overly sweet, and te Wildberry flavor is. I don't want to be overly dramatic about it. I can tolerate the Wildberry flavor, and I'll use up all of the remainder of this box, but I sure don't want to get it by accident again.
I have chronic GERD and have used Prilosec OTC at my doctor's direction now for nearly 10 years, and before when it was only available by prescription. It has always worked very well for me and keeps my stomach irritation and GERD under control. Users and new people to this drug should be aware that these are time release pills not meant for immediate relief. It usually takes several hours for it to kick in, but it will last for 24hrs once it does. These don't work like a tums or rolaids and should not be compered to them.
Out of no where, I was starting to get a burning in my throat.  I didn't think anything of it, until reoccurred  many times. It was then that I recognized the symptoms of an issue I had many years ago.  At first I thought it was just an episode of single episode of heart burn, but then the symptoms  continued, and I knew it was Acid reflux and I needed to do something ASAP.Years ago, when i had this problem, my Physician had to try a myriad of prescription medicines to get this issue resolved.  In the long run, I had ended up on over the counter Prilosec.  So this time when my symptoms returned out of no where, I ordered my old faithful friend, Prilosec.Although the Prilosec directions indicate this is not intended for intended for the immediate relief of heartburn, and that you need to take it over several weeks, as it needs time to work (at least a full day), I felt better in a matter of hours!  This stuff works.If you are suffering a similar problem, i recommend you try this product.
STRESS, SPICY FOODS, THAT NEW MEDICATION, YOUR FINANCES, THE ECONOMY, YOUR BOSS, YOUR GENES, etc, - WHATEVER upsets you - PRILOSEC will settle things down! There is NO BETTER OTC treatment for heartburn, acid reflux, etc, than PRILOSEC, and NO MATTER HOW BAD YOURS IS, or HOW LONG YOU'VE SUFFERED, or WHAT THE CAUSE IS, Prilosec will END your suffering! Just buy it and take it - on empty stomach first thing in the morning - and leave the problem behind FOREVER, even tho your circumstances stay the same! Plan on taking it every morning FOR LIFE and stop suffering! Such a simple solution to a MAJOR LIFE-RUINING PROBLEM - just suck up the expense, and start enjoying your life! (Maybe put it on Subscribe and Save so you never run out?)
This takes a little time to work (and therefore isn't for people just need it rarely for heartburn)  but after I took it a few days I felt better then I had in a long time.  I had been using cheaper OTC brands and Tums and they just don't compare to Prilosec.  I'm pretty much free of heartburn and acid reflex now, I can even lay down and watch a movie in bed now.  I have it on subscribe and save every month.  Great product and price.
Literally, changed my quality of life. I never had heartburn until I gave birth. I first used Pepcid (which worked for awhile) but was up to 2 extra strength a day. I finally got an upper GI and found out I had Level 2 reflux. They put me on this and immediately I was 'cured'. I was no longer waking up at night, didn't have to sleep with an elevated head and could eat later if I wanted to. I wish I had found this years ago. I've recommended it to other people I know and they thank me. It really not only helps the immediate effects of reflux, it will in time, repair the damage.
Got this for a great price, and I have to take these daily, according to my gastro doctor.  Love the berry flavor.  Sure beats paying $60 for a month's prescription.
I have been a Prilosec user for about four years now. In the past, I would do the 2 week recommended period, then stop for a couple of weeks, and continue that cycle. My acid reflux never got any better except on the days I took the Prilosec. The day I would stop it would be right back. Finally, I found out that most people take it as a maintenace medication, so I started taking it once a day without fail and my acid reflux was finally gone forever! I used to wake up all night long with severe esophageal pain, sometimes vomiting right in bed from all the acid. It was such a nightmare. I would end up taking a half bottle of tums which still wouldn't work, and sleep sitting up. I tried every over the counter medication out there with no relief at all until Prilosec. It truly is a miracle drug. For those of you out there with acid reflux, don't suffer any longer! Try this and give it about 3 days to start working, and you will be able to turn your sleep and your life around. Amazon often has specials such as spend $49 on groceries (this qualifies) and get $10 off your order. By all means, double up on Prilosec and do this.... I am now 2 years acid reflux free!  It's not so bad, if I miss a day now, I don't suffer at all.
My husband has been using this under his doctor's recommendation for over a year now.  He had struggled for a long time with no relief with other medications.He has tried generic formulation (one of the warehouse stores) and did not have as good of results.  So Amazon's subscribe and save has been a nice cost savings.  Because he is using this under his doctor's recommendation (ie he has a prescription) he will be able to continue to use this with his FSA when the rules change in 2011.
As my acid reflux worsened over the years, I made the usual progression from antacid tablets, to Pepcid AC, and eventually to prescription medications like Prevacid and Nexium. Prevacid works great but it still requires a prescription and Nexium caused side effects in me. Once Prilosec was offered over the counter I gave it a try and was very impressed. After a week or two of taking it every day, I was able to decrease the dosage to the point where I only take it as needed now. Once I feel heartburn starting, or I eat something guaranteed to give me heartburn, I just take one of these and its gone in about 30 minutes...and when I say gone I mean gone for 10-12 hours.I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers acid reflux or chronic heartburn.
I ADORE digital pregnancy tests. When I was trying to get pregnant with my first son, I could ALWAYS convince myself that I saw two lines on the regular tests .... even if I had to hold it up to a 100-watt bulb at a 33.8-degree angle and squint with my right eye. The digital tests leave NO room for doubt, and they're fairly sensitive, too. The instructions that come with it are very detailed.The only downside is that they're a little on the pricey side, so if you're like me and start testing 10 days past ovulation, your pregnancy-test bills may run up pretty fast!
Not much to say other than it works are advertised.  Easy to read.  However, it is a lot more expensive than other kinds that are just as easy to read.
It's easy to read.  The result was accurate for me.  I have no complaints.
Well this pregnancy test does what it says it should.  It tell you whether you are pregnant or not.  Some people may prefer this test since it actually says the words Pregnant or Not Pregnant as opposed to a plus or minus sign, etc.  In reality they all do the same thing so it's not like I can rate this pregnancy test better than say EPT or something like that.  We have not had any false positives but it should be noted that some other reviewers have but in all fairness if you look at reviews of other brands you will find bad reviews complaining about false positives also so I don't think it's just this brand.  It just happens sometimes regardless of brands.  Overall this is a nice, typical pregnancy test.  No false positives for us and no problems so I gave it five stars.
Works as advertised and is easy to read.  What more could you ask for?
Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which occurs 6 to 12 days after implantation. The Tests with the "two pink lines for positive" sometimes do not detect the hCG level in women who do not produce a high level, like me, if they are pregnant.I have gone through trying to get pregnant and buying the cheaper tests, only to be staring at a stick in the bathroom going "is ...that a line?..." Its frustrating, its expensive and its never good to be stressed out during that delicate time, whether you are pregnant or not.Clearblue Easy DIGITAL pregnancy tests have a digital window. You pee on the stick, wait a few minutes and there it is...Negative or Positive. NO GUESSING.The only drawback, that I have heard other women say, is that you cannot keep these for a scrapbook or to show your kids an ancient stick you peed on. The digital readout eventually goes away. I personally dont care.
What else do i need to say about this product than to say it works.  My wife xpected she was pregnant, we first used those cheap test first.  After the cheap one said YES, we used this one to just confirm the test result.  Still said YES.  Anyways, it works.
So i received this through the vine program and me and my husband are trying to have a baby so when i saw this it was perfect. We have only been trying for about a month and i was on birth control for over ten years, so i know it will take time. I tried out one test because1) There's three in the box2) Have to get a review in for Vine3) Wanted to see how easy it is to useAnd after using one of the tests i can say it works well. Easy, effective and non messy. Just hold. cap it, lay it down and wait for the timer bar to get full and show results. I must say this test is fool proof. Easy Peasy
Very impressed with these, but don't think I would pay this much in the future.Let me explain what I use these for.  I do not have a regular cycle and when I do, it's often false ovulation.  I work with my doctor to monitor my health...but I use pregnancy tests on a regular basis to make sure I'm not pregnant. (I also get blood clots from birth control, so they are a no go). Given my situation, dollar store tests have worked great for years.However, these tests are very nice.  They are easy to use and results are clearly understood.  You can use them earlier than other brands (the cheap ones any ways) and they are way more hygienic.For someone who is trying to get pregnant and wants an accurate product...I'd tell them that this one is worth every penny.For my situation, I'll stick to cheaper ones.
