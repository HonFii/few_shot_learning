This product is advertised as the NEW Energizer Rechargeable NiMH AA Batteries. But once you received it, you may be shocked to find out that: the rated capacity of those NEW batteries is just '2300mAh', lower than the previous generation of '2500mAh' Energizer NiMH cells. So are you really getting a new and improved product, or just some old inventory from many years ago?The fact is, Energizer has discontinued the '2500mAh' series of rechargeable AA NiMH cells, presumably due to massive complaints about rapid-self-discharge problem. All new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells, using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer. Here are my findings:- Fresh out of the package, those cells hold an average of 330mAh, or just 14% of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time, they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles, the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations, I can conclude that those 'New' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity. They are not the LSD (low-self-discharge) type pioneered bySANYO eneloop. This is very disappointing, because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced LSD products similar to eneloop, such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged. In contrast, the Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back' its battery technology to circa 2004.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is: they _probably_ don't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells.In summary, those so-called 'New' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than LSD NiMH cells (2000-2100mAh), yet do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate. As of this writing, this product is priced at nearly 2x higher than LSD cells. So it is just a bad deal.
As many other reviewers have pointed out, these batteries have a very high self-discharge rate.  This means that within a short period of time (for me about 7-10 days) they will be completely dead even if you completely charged them and never used them.  The only reason I didn't give these batteries 1 star is because they do work well right out of the charger.  But you pretty much have to use them within 2-3 days of charging.  Wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged.  I  know I didn't just get a bad batch either because I have a couple dozen of these Energizers which I purchased over the course of 2+ years.  I didn't notice the discharge rate at first because I used to charge my batteries pretty frequently to make sure I always had a fresh set in whatever device I was using.  But eventually I started noticing that even my "freshly charged" batteries weren't lasting very long.  So I started paying closer attention to how frequently I charged my batteries and realized that even after a week they would be mostly or completely dead.I've switched over to Rayovac Hybrids and Sanyo Eneloops which both have a much lower self-discharge.  I've very happy with both of them and would definitely recommend either of them over these Energizers.  I hope that Energizer eventually comes out with some low self-discharge batteries because I really like their other batteries.  But avoid the rechargeables.  They're just not worth it.
There aren't enough bristles and they are too soft to clean effectively.  I used it on my tea jar that gets a residue build up and I couldn't even get it all off.  I don't see it holding up for long either, seems really cheap.  I usually like OXO products, but this one is a dud.
I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted "like vitamins", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar.
I opened my door this afternoon to find that a big box from Amazon.com had been delivered. Did I order a new wide-screen TV? Ha, ha, ha, I'm kidding, of course. The box wasn't THAT big, just much bigger than necessary for the contents: one solitary Power Bar of the fruit smoothie variety.I tore open the wrapping, took a bite, and said, "Hmm, this isn't bad." It had a kind of strawberry flavor. On the other hand, it had a texture similar to a Tootsie Roll which once laid claim to one of my teeth. To avoid an expensive dental accident, I chewed softly and slowly until an aftertaste began to emerge. Hmm. Not sure about that aftertaste.I carried on, biting off another piece, chewing, swallowing, etc, until I reached the final bite. It was then that I'd had enough and tossed the remainder in the trash.Final verdict: I didn't like it. Something about that aftertaste. It wasn't horrible, just a little unpleasant, and the original flavor couldn't compensate. So sorry.  Oh, I almost forgot. This is a "power" bar which means it's supposed to give you a burst of energy (or something) after you eat it.  Did it have the intended effect? I really don't know. I drink so much coffee that the caffeine almost certainly overwhelmed the ingredients in the power bar.Brian W. Fairbanks
Power Bar Fruit Smoothie, Berry BlastI like the flavor of this bar, but, the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein. If it had less sugar and more protein, I'd recommend it.Gunner  June, 2008
As someone who has eaten his fair share of Powerbars, I found this to be my least favorite of all.  The first bite tasted like Flintstones chewable vitamins from my childhood.  As I ate more, the Fliststone's taste lessened a bit, enough for me to finish the bar.It tastes like a raspberry-blueberry mix might taste.  It definetly does not tast like strawberry, which is the first-listed berry on the ingredients list.  To its credit, only raspberries and blueberries are pictured on the wrapper.This product is very soft.  The softness makes it feel like it melted, but that is not the case because it was room temperature.  It is very chewy and is easily mishapen because it is so soft.  The texture and grittiness reminds me of Airheads candy, but much, much softer.Overall, I probably would not purchase this product in the store now that I have tasted it.  I would like to try the other flavors though.
I tried this Powerbar with another person.  We both were not pleased with the taste.  We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste, we didn't think we'd ever want another One!  I don't think we are going to finish this bar.  Not the best I've ever tasted and I would never buy this again!
First immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.Apart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar.
I ate two small bites of this Powerbar (it was a free sample), then decided my usual "don't waste food" rule was not going to be obeyed in this case.I can't imagine anyone choosing this product for any reason other than perceived convenience.  Basically, this is a paste which has been extruded into a rectangular "bar" shape.  To me, it tasted artificial and highly processed (maybe not as bad as a Twinkie or Fruit Loops cereal, but still kind of "icky"). It definitely did not taste like a berry smoothie to me; instead, it tasted like finely ground oatmeal mixed with overly sweetened fruit juice.The first ingredient listed is sugar cane syrup, while the third ingredient is sugar.  Rice flour, oats, soy and locust beans are mixed with dried berries, juice concentrate (pear, pineapple, apple, and peach), milk protein isolate, and additional ingredients including almond butter, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids are added.  The resulting paste is colored with beet juice.I'm left thinking a far tastier and healthier snack for athletes would be a banana and a handful of almonds (and that option would cost less than fifty cents).
.... which was not very long at all. As a nose trimmer that was operable, it cut very cleanly and without much irritation. The motor on this device however, decided it wanted to quit far too soon. No motor, no trimmer.
I've been using my Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush set with these Oral-B Sensitive brush heads for over 4yrs now.  I GENERALLY am a review & research freak and will ONLY purchase something that I've read reviews on but I went in for a dental appointment years ago and my dentist insisted that this would help my receding & inflammed gum issues and assured me that HE did his research and assured me that this IS the absolute best product out there, told me about some testimonials of his customers so I was sold! I plunked my money down and have faithfully been using it.Since this was my first electric toothbrush, I couldn't compare any former experience and simply didn't know any better.  I DO have to say that other than my 'unsanitary' concern about these that I'll get to in a moment, it's great! I love it, it allows me to thoroughly brush without worrying about brushing too hard, it's very easy and uncomplicated to use, the charge on the toothbrush portion holds for a long time, these toothbrushes are really comfortable, stay on just fine, I have never had any 'break' or get wobbly on me, there is a color indicator where the blue area on your toothbrush gets lighter over time to let you know when it's time to swap out your toothbrush, etc.Let me start off with my complaint saying that I am a very hygienic person, I brush 2-3 times per day, floss, clean my tongue, take showers every day, my bathroom is not musty - it's clean & smells good, my home is clean - in fact I'm actually somewhat of a germaphobe so I HAVE to have things clean or it grosses me out.  I know it's odd to point all that out but I didn't want anyone disgarding my main complaint about these toothbrushes by thinking it was me or my lack of hygiene.  :-).No matter WHAT I do...I've tried using bottled water to brush my teeth thinking it's our tap water (it's not...my kids & hubby don't have an issue w/ their toothbrushes); I've tried switching to a different toothsoap / tooth powder / toothpaste - and I STILL have the same issue.  My hubby & dentist have confirmed that I don't have an issue w/ bad breath or abcessed teeth so it's not in my mouth...so I'm left to think that is DEFINITELY the DESIGN of Oral-B toothbrush replacements heads!!!Humor me for a minute and do a 'zoom' on the picture of Oral-B replacement toothbrushes in the middle of the toothbrush handle.  There is a small opening...like a mini window where you can see a teeny metal spring inside.  Well, as you brush your teeth, if you put too much toothpaste on, some of it can leak into this teeny opening OR if you are careful and no toothpaste / toothsoap run off gets on the handle while brushing then certainly a mixture of that & water runs over the handle area and if not everytime you brush then SOMETIMES some of the gunk gets in.I DO make a habit of actually removing my brush head in running water and I try to be certain that none of that residue is neither on the electric toothbrush handle portion (where the brush sticks & on the bottom where you place the charger) AND on the toothbrush head itself - both on the brush area and on & inside the handle and yet they still have this slight musty smell to them from time to time that grosses me out.  I actually have to change them MUCH more often than normal and wipe down my electric toothbrush handle with peroxide & a clean washcloth (since I didn't know where the smell was coming from) AND I stick the toothbrush heads through a clean cycle in my dishwasher every week or hot, hot water and let it air dry AND rotate brush heads so each one gets a chance to thoroughly dry.  It does NOT happen when I take all of these precautions but in my opinion, I shouldn't HAVE to do this in order to avoid the musty smell...musty stench means that bacteria is harboring & growing so to stick something filled with germs to 'clean' with is not the best option in my opinion.FYI: On several occasions, I swapped to a manual toothbrush to be certain that it's not me and sure enough, it's not me! A friend of mine has a Sonicare brand and doesn't have that teeny hole in the brush handle so I'm currently on a search in reading reviews and comparing models to replace my Oral-B set.  Bummer - I love it otherwise but I think it's a design flaw in the brush design.I'd rather not have to worry if my toothbrush is growing bacteria or not, I want to simply rinse the brush & handle after each use and store it away like I'm supposed to be able to do.  I SHOULD be able to use it until the blue indicator bristles tell me that I need to change it and not any sooner.  I don't understand how anyone else hasn't complained about this issue - maybe I'm taking care of them wrong but I've even called the company and it was suggested that maybe it was our water or toothpaste...when I told her that my other family members didn't have this issue, she was at a loss.For those who are also looking & comparing brands: At a GLANCE at the pictures here on Amazon, the Sonicare replacement toothbrush heads do not seem to have that window on the brush head - just like my friend said AND the bottom of it looks like it's more dome shaped so the toothpaste 'gunk' from brushing & rinsing I would hope would simply slide off the 'dome shape' vs getting embedded in the area that your toothbrush head handle & electric toothbrush handle would connect.  The Oral-B's design is more flush - flat if you will so gunk can easily get in so you have to rinse it out thoroughly after each use.I did give this item a 2 star review because I DO like how it is soft for those w/ enamel issues and does get in small spaces of your teeth (like the last set of teeth in the back) and you can easily clean your entire set of teeth with this brush head unlike some of the larger ones where it's hard to get in small areas of your mouth.
I have used this a couple of times as a pretreatment along with a BISSELL ReadyClean machine.  I did not get the results I had hoped for on a very fresh stain.  The cat threw up some raw meat, so I guess that would be similar to blood.  After cleaning the bulk of the stain, only a slight pink stain remained.  The stain was less than ten minutes old when I pretreated per instructions.  I used the machine over and over the spot till it seemed clean.  Once you start cleaning and the carpet is wet, it's kind of hard to see the stain until it's dry.  After the carpet dried, the stain was still prominently visible.  This is white carpet btw.Then I tried using it as a regular, spot carpet cleaner.  Still, did not completely remove the stain.  Then I used my Spot Shot carpet cleaner and the stain was finally gone.  I cannot say for sure that was due to the Spot Shot or that it was the third time I cleaned the stain.The Bissell brand is not better as a spot cleaner than either Zep High Traffic Stain Remover or the Spot Shot I mentioned.
A month of consuming these gel-caps has produced a modest but not dramatic difference.  For whose who want to relieve the problem without resorting to prescription drugs, this may be a cost-effective and adequate solution.
I have lived with chronic prostatitis regularly for the last six years. It's pretty strange for someone my age, especially since I started having the issues at the age of 22. My father has had the same issues and my younger brother began having prostate problems around the age of 18, so It must be heriditary to my gene pool. Anyways, I have tried TONS of products to relieve my worst symptoms. From every known vitamin and herb to every known perscription from a physician. I decided to give this a try and was eager to see if it had any effect on my symptoms (my main symptoms are extreme discomfort and having to go at night ALL THE TIME!). I am not impressed.I didn't notice ANY change in symptoms or discomforts related to prostate issues. I am not sure if it's the quality of the ingredients or something else, but this had no effect on my problems. I do not recommend it at all. I do have some recommendations for people though who might be searching for relief. Solaray has something out called (easy enough) Prostate Caps. They are made from bovine prostate extract and they have given me some relief. I also have to say that after two months of perscription Avodart, I am definitely showing great improvement. I highly recommend trying out Avodart if you can. Also, a multivitamin containing zinc and quercetin is a help too! Give those a try. Skip this!!
For the last 10 years my husband I have not been preventing pregnancy, but not trying either. In that time, I've had to take several tests as I am irregular and not taking birth control. I normally use the cheap HCG pregnancy test strips, but don't (didn't) actually trust them. I decided to try the Clearblue ones, as it's pretty hard to misinterpret  the reading of &#34;Pregnant&#34; or &#34;Not Pregnant&#34; and sometimes I just need to keep it simple. Plus, now we are actively trying to conceive and excited about the possibility of being pregnant.I used the HCG test 30 days after my cycle and it read negative. But I felt a little nauseous, we just started trying, I figured it was a good possibility. The Clearblue test read &#34;PREGNANT&#34; - yay! But that other test strip was still nagging at me. So I tried another one - no dice, only one line - not pregnant. So I just decided to call my doctor and go in to find out once and for all. NOPE. Not Pregnant. Now, I am out my stupid co-pay too. I will stick to my cheap HCG strips and now I trust them. Whereas these Clearblue? Notsomuch.
I've used many different types of pregnancy tests ranging from store brands to expensive name brands and I have to say, this one (which I would consider a more expensive name brand) is not worth paying extra for.  It's major feature is that it clearly reads "pregnant" or "not pregnant" on the indicator, but other than that, you pee on it and the collection part of the stick is not any larger or easier to use and it gives you results in the same amount of time as any other test I've used.  It was accurate for me, so that is not an issue.  Overall, if you can't figure out how to read a traditional pregnancy test, which simply has a "+" or "-", then this is the test for you, but if that is the case, perhaps you should seriously reconsider having kids.
This worked reasonably well for the first week, then began to read erratically, for example giving me only 177 steps in a 2 mile walk. (My legs are long, but not THAT long.) Haven't been able to figure out the problem, but with all the exposed buttons, it is possible that some setting was messed up banging into something in a pocket. It is not designed to deal with that.The design is very cute and sleek looking, but not very functional. I prefer ergonomically sound and functional over cute. The belt clip is weak and it pops off a belt or pocket top very easily. It is bulky and oddly shaped, making it difficult to fit into pockets or to fit comfortably on a belt (if it would even stay in place).I have to say I am not impressed, and if I had found the problems sooner, would have returned it. I will continue to work with it and see if I can discover the problem, but I do not having to spend my valuable time troubleshooting something right out of the box.  I will update when I have more info about the malfunction.
I received this as a well-intentioned birthday gift...it was purchased here on Amazon by the gifter...I am reviewing this as the giftee. Overall, I am less than satisfied with the Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer; here are both the pluses & minuses:pluses :========+ convenient small size+ easy to read displayminuses:========- current data cannot be reset; I was amazed by the lack of this feature! You have to wait until 12:00AM for it to zero out (or reset ALL of the stored settings, including your stride, weight and time)- does not have an on/off button for the display: wastes battery unnecessarily- does not allow for storing more than one user's stride & weight: so, if your partner would like to share it, you will have to repeatedly reset this data- very restrictive in what positions and walking styles are allowed: this is covered more by other reviewers)- unfriendly packaging: you have to destroy the molded plastic it comes in to extract it...renders it nonreturnable.- it's calorie & fat-burning algorithm seems like fuzzy logic; a gram a fat has 9 calories...they provide no explanation why their numbers are differentThere is also an "FCC Statement" stating "the product generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and...may cause harmful interference to radio communication".I just want a basic device that can measure the distance I walk (without placing unreasonable limits on how & where I walk), and allows me to reset it...and also lets someone else use it if they'd like to. This one, for all of its fancy digital attributes, fails. I long for the old mechanical pedometer I had years ago!If I had purchased this myself, I would have returned it.
This Jarrow Bone- up has a good type of Calcium in it, as from what I have read it Absorbs pretty good, Hydroxyapatite.The bottle says to take 6 caps a day, which I think is uncalled for. Although You would take 2caps three times a day,. And I think that is a pain in the neck.We can only absorb about 300mg to 500 mg calcium at a time !We also get calcium from vegetables which is better absorbed then eating dairy, or taking calcium vitamins.The oval capsules might be considered big for some people to take!I do not think taking 6 capsules is enough of 1000iu D3. From what my Dr. say's, we should be taking 5000iu of D3 a day.There are other minerals in this, but for me, I do not think enough. I do not think there is enough of everything, so this is a waste except if you want to take calcium.I do have Osteoporosis. I'm not so sure it is the calcium we need. Magnesium might be more important!If this type of calcium helps our bones, we would only know it unless we had a DEXA Scan.There is K2 Mk-7 in this. But K2 MK-4 is more important then Mk-7.Mk-7 is inexpensive. We need to take K2-Mk-4 which takes the calcium to our bones and not our arteries/soft tissue. I do not see Mk-4 in this, as it is expensive, and has ashort shelve life in the body.We need to take Mk4 about every 5 to 6 hours with some healthy fat for it to absorb. K2 Mk7 we do not need to take everyday, as it stays in the body for about 2 to 3 days. Depending on how much you take!As far as taking calcium goes, I think this is a pretty good choice, although Food would be a better choice.
This would be great supplement if only I didn't have to swallow 6 pills daily! I found it outrageous especially when other calcium supplements are available in higher doses in 1 pill.here 120 capsules makes 20 day supply only so this is not a great option if you need calcium everyday in a pill form.
After getting to the bottom of the bottle, I have to change my review. I am experiencing eye twitches and sleep disturbances- symptoms associated with calcium deficiency. I was hoping to have a new, less expensive calcium supplement, but it looks like I am going back to the drawing board. I don't know if it's an absorption issue or a formulation issue, but I seem to do better with liquid supplements. Oh, well. It was worth a try.
This product is basically menthol gel. It contains a number of ingredients that have a cooling effect. It's a topical analgesic, which means it's good for pain or irritation on the skin but not really for anything deeper. It does feel good going on your skin, and I used it on a mosquito bite and found that it really stopped the itching. I rubbed it on my forearm where I had a muscle strain, and I can't say that it did anything to alleviate that discomfort. The cooling effect does distract you from the muscle pain, though, I think. The gel takes awhile to dry, and there's that BenGay smell to deal with. It doesn't actually do anything to your muscles to care for the injury. It's not physiologically cold, so it doesn't reduce swelling. The packaging says this product employs the same "technology" that physical therapists and chiropractors use. Yes, they sometimes put a cooling product on the skin before a therapeutic massage. It does provide a little additional relief, but it's not therapeutic in and of itself.So bottom line - I don't think this offers real relief for muscle pain, but it can help with skin irritation.
The positive aspect of this is that it smells like the BENGAY of old without the 'yuck' factor of the petroleum jelly based old stuff. I always liked the menthol smell of that and I find it comforting, since my mother used it on me as a child. Unlike the jelly-based product, this is absorbed into the skin quickly, leaving just the smell.However, as for 'pain relief' there seems to be nothing much happening, which would be expected given the lack of any ingredients that would seem to do much for pain. It is slightly soothing, which is nice, but that's about it, as it doesn't seem powerful enough to deal with real muscle aches and such. And if I needed something for sunburn I'd use aloe vera gel as that's very effective.
Bengay Cold Therapy, nice product look, right size, the scent was not over-powering.  So that's the pro's.  Con's -  The product really goes on gooey, very wet, slick.  More than any other product I've tried.  It didn't help the ache in my lower back at all.  Perhaps it works only on minor aches and pains.  I wish I could give it more of a review but it just didn't work.
I was pretty disappointed with this product as far as its pain-relieving abilities go.  It really didn't do much for the pain.  Something like icy hot is much more effective.  The cooling sensation is nice, and it does not smell horrible (it's not great, but better than other pain-relieving creams), and those are the only two reasons I gave it two stars instead of one.  I would not purchase this product.  Icy hot or aspercream are more effective.  This was nothing more than a mild cooling sensation, and it does not perform the way it is supposed to.  Save yourself the trouble and buy another brand.
I honestly didn't see that this product worked any better than the generic blue cold therapy product I buy at the drug store. (Twice as much product for less than the Ben Gay.) Of note, this product's main ingredient is 5% Menthol and my generic is only 2%. This product does seem to have slightly less of a pronounced menthol smell than my generic.
Didn't notice any difference in anything. I know this was only a limited supply, but if a supplement is going to work, it should show some sort of sign by this point.Not recommended.
I was worried about using these L-Glutamine tablets since there are many warnings that this product can induce mania. While I don't have any history of depression and I'm not bi-polar, this wasn't exactly the most settling thing to read. While the L-Glutaimine didn't make me feel anxious, it didn't make me feel anything else either.Those thinking about trying this product should know that the pills themselves are fine. They're a bit bigger than many other supplements, but I wouldn't say that they're too large. I also didn't feel any stomach aches as I've felt with other supplements.This is a supplement that you should consult with your doctor before sampling. I didn't feel any negative side effects, but the possibility of them suggests that those seeking to use this should make sure that it's right for them.
I thought this might be a good product for me as it talked about possibly helping with mood in dieters.  For me though, I need seratonin and this effects seratonin in a negative way.If you are taking any psychiatric medicine, I suggest consulting with your doctor prior to taking this.I only took a couple of these before I had to stop.
Been trying the various Jarrow formulas addressing joint pain etc.An exceptional product Jarrow Sam E 400 wowed us.  Took it for a few weeks and then started the Jarrow MSM 1000 instead.Since the MSM was cheaper than the Jarrow Sam E, thought it might be worth a try.So far, there has not been that continuous comfort, less joint pain etc that we enjoyed with the Sam E.A call to Jarrow even advised us that both products could be taken as their formulas were each unique.Our own opinion, after giving it our best, is that MSM 1000 did not provide the wonderful joint and pain relief of the Sam E by Jarrow.  In addition, somehow the MSM made us feel uncomfortable and somewhat bloated.Our own experience...
Jarrow is a good brand, and they produce much of their products in gel form. But tablets just don't break down well in your body. Too many things you don't need in "hard" pills. In fact a great deal of research reveals that hard pills only make about 10% of what your taking available to absorb. So am I not getting 1,000mg, only 100mg.This means you'll have to take more of the product, making it last a shorter time, increasing costs.
Ever since I first was struck with kidney stones I have been very aware of supplements' dissolvability. My urologist suggested I place the pill or tablet in warm water for about an hour.  If the pill dissolves it is ok if it takes much more that an hour it is not, it is that simple.  To have pills sit in your body for hours or days does no good to your system and can lead to excessive stones.Unfortunately this MSM does not dissolve quickly,  It sat in the water for over a day, this I am not going to risk another stone attack.
If you are environmentally conscious, or if you are concerned about eventually etching your dishes with phosphates in your dishwasher, you should be using zero phosphate detergent.  Many states now limit phosphates to 0.5% in dishwasher detergent.  This Finish product is exactly at that limit.  While it might be quite low, it is still not zero.  We are going back to the Cascade detergent we were using previously, which is at zero and cleans well (Cascade ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 85-Count).  I am disappointed that the manufacturer did not provide the phosphate level in the Amazon listing.
got these through the subscribe and save after the finish gel packs were no longer offered.big disappointment. left residue on dishes and glasses where previously there was none.I will find a better product and/or be forced to go the a grocery store instead of Amazon.too bad.
The description for this product is intriguing. It is "derived from vincamine, an alkaloid naturally occurring in Voacanga seeds. Vinpocetine supports brain metabolism..."I felt like I was slightly more awake after taking this supplement. Unfortunately it had a side effect on my body: a burning sensation upon urination. After I made the connection between the symptom and the supplement, I stopped taking the capsules and the symptom was gone the next day. In fairness, I have had this symptom with some other supplements and I tend to be very sensitive, so you may never have this reaction.I did a little research after discontinuing the Vinpocetine and learned that producing it requires significant chemical work performed in the laboratory. We tend to assume that supplements from Jarrow are natural, but Vinpocetine doesn't exist to any significant extent in nature. Voacanga seeds contain a number of different alkaloids and have been used as a poison as well as a source of medicine! Vinpocetine can be derived from more than one plant, and other brands manufacture it from an alkaloid found in the periwinkle plant.Most of the studies I saw were positive about Vinpocetine, although there are contraindications so do read them before using this product and do not use if you take blood thinning medications. WebMD states that "Vinpocetine appears to be POSSIBLY SAFE for most people... Vinpocetine can cause some side effects including stomach pain, nausea, sleep disturbances, headache, dizziness, nervousness, and flushing of the face."A study of Alzheimer's patients used much larger doses than the amount in these capsules, 60 mg. versus 5 mg. No significant harmful effects were reported.If you have any medical conditions I suggest reading the description for this product very thoroughly and consult with a medical professional before using.
Based on research cited on nih.gov, this supplement has not been shown effective in improving cognitive deficits or age-related decline.  However there is support for it's use as an anti-inflammatory treatment.Tried it for a month with no change and no side-effects.
I'm really disappointed in Enfamil for pumping artificial ingredients into their supplement drops. You'd think with the upper hand of artificial additives that they could make a product that actually tastes appealing to little ones, but nope. Other than being a multivitamin and thus providing a nutritional benefit (if you can get your child to actually take these and keep them down) these drops have no redeeming qualities. There are better options out there that don't contain these unnecessary ingredients and make for a much happier baby. I will not be ordering these again.
First, I don't think it's very nutritious. It has 250 calories with 34 carbs and 9 grams of fat. The ingredients are horrible with corn syrup being the very first ingredient.It didn't mix well and ours had clumps in it that we couldn't get out with stirring. Maybe a blender would work better. It also had that disgusting powder flavor. It was watery and not very rich tasting.I've used other shake mixes in the past like Slim Fast that were delicious tasting.This is definitely a big no for us. The kids wouldn't even finish it.
I have used a lot of meal replacement drinks, especially during certain months of the year when I spend a lot of time in my car.  It is so easy to pull one out of my cooler and so much healthier than the ever-so-easy drive-thrus.  Almost any of the drinks are a good idea, even though this one only has 9 mg protein.This one has the distinction of being kind of flavorless.  It caused me to think about the old idea of white ice cream, from before the vanilla flavor seemed so significant - like white meant the absence of flavor.I was able to avoid the powdery and clumpy side effects by using aBlenderBottle Classic 28-ounce Black.* One can makes 7 servings of 250 calorie 8 ounce drinks (!).* It has 15-30% DV of most vitamins except 60% of  vitamin C.* One 8 ounce serving has 190 mg Sodium. (8%DV)* One 8 ounce serving has 34 g carbs /13 g sugars* The first ingredient is Corn Syrup.These are all things that I would have noticed if I had picked the can up in the store.  Then I would have put the can back on the shelf.
The Ensure powder version tastes terrible when used as directed.  The only way I could get my son to drink this was to prepare it with milk and add extra powder.  I would not purchase the powder.  The ready-made bottles or cans taste much better, and are worth the extra cost.
While I prefer the taste of Boost brand nutrition drinks, I have had the Ensure bottles several times.  I always feel wasteful purchasing and tossing out individual serving plastic bottles of any beverage.  They are also quite expensive so I decided to give this "nutrition" powder a try.The instructions say to gradually add 1/2 cup of Ensure powder to 3/4 cup of cold water and stir until dissolved.  This takes too long.  It is better to use a shake bottle or the blender (I used my magic bullet blender).  The blender definitely gives you a smoother drink.  The instructions also say for Flavor Variety, you may add chocolate syrup or strawberry syrup.  This doesn't seem very advisable to me considering that one serving already gives you a whopping 13 grams of sugar.  This sugar source is from corn syrup (FIRST listed ingredient), corn maltodextrin and sugar.  One is better off adding fresh strawberries or unsweetened cocoa powder for flavor variety.The overall taste is fine.  I think it could use some more of the vanilla flavor.  I actually added some real vanilla extract to improve it.  The bottled versions taste better.According to the Nutrition Facts on the label, one 14 oz can will yield 7 servings.  You will save money purchasing the powder versus the bottled versions if you don't mind forsaking the convenience of a pre-mix.Because of the high sugar content I wouldn't make this product a mainstay in my home.  I would probably just buy an unflavored protein powder and add that to soy or almond milk and fresh fruit to make my own drinks.  I don't like corn by products and there is nothing on the label that states the product is non-GMO.  I would give it a 1-star based on the ingredient list alone but I don't think this product is any worse than any of the other nutrition shake brands.
Not crazy about the taste of this.  Why are products like this so sweet?  The first three ingredients listed are sweeteners.  I was also fairly surprised to see how much -- 1/2 a cup -- you need to use for 8 oz of water.  Most protein powders and nutritional supplements require half that amount per serving.  I'm not sure it's worth it unless you or someone you care for isn't getting adequate nutrition because of a medical issue.
I was hoping this would help me to be calmer and more serene.  I took it twice a day for a month and didn't notice much difference.  Some days I was calm and I thought it was helping but then the next day something stressful would happen and I would react as usual.  The only supplement that I've ever taken where I've really noticed an improvement in my energy and focus is bio-strath. Everyone is different obviously - what helps one person may not help another and it seems that Holy Basil has been very effective for some.
I took this for a few months and didn't really notice much of a change.  I take around 15 supplements each day from vitamins, probiotics, to pills for my vision, and I like to try new ones from time to time to see if I can improve how I feel.  As with many in the past this pill did not really change my health or mood, at least not enough for me to notice and make purchasing it again worth my while.  Maybe it works for some, maybe it will work for you, but at least for me, I'll keep searching and trying new things.
I have not noticed any type of boost from taking this product.  It does not leave any unpleasant aftertaste or gastric upset, but I didn't have any noticeable mood improvement from taking it consistently.
First off, I'm sure this supplement is harmless. Basil: Nothing wrong with that. Of course, fresh basil in your food would be best, but these supplements are far more convenient.However, given that these pills cost real money, it's worth asking whether there are real benefits. So I tried them. I can't speak to any of the more outlandish claims ("Supports normal insulin metabolism"? "Protects healthy cells from radiation?"), which don't appear to have any studies backing them up. I don't have any blood sugar issues or other health problems, other than sometimes feeling stressed out. So I was hoping that these pills would "promote natural stress relief," as the bottle says. Alas, I noticed no difference in stress levels while taking these pills.If you try these pills and find that they "elevate your spirit," then by all means stick with them. But as for me, I suspect that my money would be better spent on other things.
I'm All For Herbs But Saw No Change By Taking This Product.  I grow my own herbs and have for the past 20 years.  I took the whole bottle of supplements and did not notice a change or improvement in my health.  Save your money...
I use essential oils for many things in my life and I have bought Now Lavender oil is 1 oz bottles twice before .  I've decided to buy a 4 oz bottle but twice now the product I have received smells like cough syrup.  The 1 oz bottles of Lavender I have used in the past and the bottle I am nearly finished with does not smell this way.This is my second 4 oz bottle, the first bottle I received a refund so I thought I would try to buy another just to see if it was a fluke but no this second 4 oz also smells like cough syrup. I'm going to order a different brand instead of NOW brand. I don't think my expectations are wrong as to what Lavender EO smells like either because the seller who sold me the first 4 oz told me he has other customers who have also complained.
I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain....
I presently own a Polar Chest Strap monitor and thought it would be a good idea to get an additional monitor to carry in my gym bag as a tend to lose things.The difference between the two monitors is night and day in a bad way.  With this model I cannot:1.  Track my average heart rate over a workout2.  Track the calories burned in my workout3.  Look at the continuous and heart rate at the same time (split screen)4.  Easily slip between modes5.  Enter height, weight and fitness level for an accurate calorie count.I can do all of these things with my Polar monitor. This model is useful to me  only as a glorified watch.
Sometimes it's right on, sometimes its measurements are pretty jumpy.  By pretty jumpy I mean bouncing around within a 50 bpm range.  I'm not sure why.  I fiddled around with it and tested various levels of sking dampness under the chest strap.  I eventually gave up and switched over to a Garmin unit which cost a lot more but is also far more accurate.  Maybe the Omron deserves more than two stars, but it now sits in a drawer while I use something else to do the same job.
When these first came out, I thought they were great. In fact, I couldn't believe how well they got stains out. I was very impressed. I always carried one in my purse as I spill stuff on my shirt DAILY. Yes, daily. I'm that messy.However, not too long into their production cycle, I noticed they changed the material of the tips of these pens. Initially, they were a kind of felt material. A tad absorbent. Now they are hard plastic and I feel this is the reason these no longer work for me. Ever since they changed the tip material, I have been really disappointed with how these pens perform. What I'm left with now every time I try and get a stain out is a two-tiered stain; the larger stain where the Tide liquid expanded to and the original stain itself. Hard to know which is worse - my now larger-in-size and faded two-tiered stain or the original stain itself. Think about it: when you get a stain on something, using something absorbent really helps blot out the stain. With this plastic tip, all you're doing is spreading the stain out to a larger area. I remember when I first used these, the tip would get slightly off-colored...it was absorbing the stain.Until they switch back to a felt tip, I'm done with these. They are a huge waste of money and succeed only in lightening the stain a little and creating a larger, off-colored surrounding stain.
Normally I'm mad when Amazon only sends me one sample to try instead of a pack/box/whatever, as they usually say they'll only be sending one individual sample. After taking one bite from the thinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter bar, I think they were doing me a favor. This thing is hands down the worst protein bar I've ever had in my life. The only good thing I can say about it is that you get 20g of protein with one bar. That being said, there are MUCH better options out there.Describing the taste isn't going to do this bar justice, because it's ten times worse than what I say. Imagine a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that's been left out of its packaging for a long time in a dry room. All the moisture has been sucked out of the poor peanut butter cup, and now you're left with a chalky "treat". Take a bit of it, and cringe at the texture that touches your tongue. You don't want to keep chewing, but you endure the suffering and keep going. First bite gone, 4 more to go. Before you even take the second bite, the taste of a corn tortilla suddenly hits your mouth. Where the heck did that come from? Why does something that's chocolate and peanut butter taste like this? Is this legal? Is this how 'healthy alternatives' are supposed to taste?When you're finally done with the bar, you'll wonder what's happened to your life. Why didn't you join the school soccer team when you had the chance? Why didn't you ask out that really cute girl who was always so nice to you? Why didn't you speak up and tell your parents that you hated the nickname they gave you? Are you really happy with your current relationship? How come you just now realized that there's a difference between attachment and love? Imagine what you could've done with your life all these years instead of just enduring things and wanting to make a change. Imagine what you could've done with that extra minute of time if you hadn't just endured this protein bar from thinkThin and just stopped while you had the time. You know it doesn't taste good, so why continue?Don't buy these.
Very disappointing texture, not creamy at all. I was hoping for something not as tough and grainy. To make sure I was not experiencing something that was normal, I purchased a different brand with the same basic configuration of fiber and protein. I'm sorry to say it was a lot better, and this bar was the texture of cardboard. I definitely will not buy this.
I realize most people like this product, but I found it nasty.  The flavor is kind of a combination of the way clay smells and a tiny hint of peanut butter.  The texture is horrible.  Definitely not "creamy" as described.  It's kind of like a mixture of clay and chalk.  Also, at 240 calories, I'm not sure how this is going to make me "thinkThin".  Seriously.  I could eat a candy bar for fewer calories.  I realize it's high in protein, but that really doesn't matter when I can't eat more than a bite or two before I give up and throw it away.
I tried the thinkThin creamy peanut butter protein bars, and to be honest, I didn't really care for them. In fact, I didn't finish the one I was eating, I just threw half of it away. I love peanut butter more than anyone I know, but this really didn't have a strong peanut butter taste (I suppose that might actually appeal to some people) The chocolate didn't taste much like chocolate, and the whole thing was pretty dry. Worst of all, it had a bitter aftertaste that I can still taste in my mouth, even as I write this review. I suppose I shouldn't judge too harshly, since it's a "health food" product and packed with protein. I wouldn't recommend it unless taste doesn't matter to you too much.
It seems like the "nutrition bar" sections at the local stores and here on Amazon have several new products every time I look.  I can't claim to have tried tons of "Gluten Free", because that's not a requirement for me, but I've had them before.  And many, many other varieties.  This is not one I'll be going back to.  I like the message and the marketing and the idea, but none of that matters when you are trying to chew what can best be described as very, very, very dry peanut butter.  And what is probably more accurately described as peanut butter flavored sawdust.  The 20g of Protein is a plus, but the 240 calories and 9 grams of fat makes me expect WAY more of a taste treat.  I am not a fat intake miser, but from a bar - if it has 9 grams, I expect a little indulgence.  I didn't get it here.
Think thin Creamy Peanut Butter bar? I have a huge problem with this bar. For one thing it has Peanut Butter in the description of the bar. PB is 12th down on the list of ingredients.  Looking on the back at the nutrition facts I can see that this bar claims to have nutrition but lacks it in a big way.  All it is is a glorified candy bar. This bar claims to have 20 grams of protein within and I just don't see how that could be. I ate it as a snack and it kept the hunger at bay for less than 30 minutes.  I can eat an ounce of cheese and it does better than that.I follow the weight watchers maintance plan as I am just maintaining my weight.  I tracked this bar with my handy dandy tracker calculator and it is 6 points.  That is waaaayyy tttttooooo much for a snack and more like meal points.  Also, it only weighs 2.1 ounces. The bar was small and melty as I had it in my purse in an air conditioned place and it was almost liquid.The nutrition facts read like this:  9 grams of fat, 300 mg of sodium, 22 huge carbs, 1 gram of fiber 0 sugars but 11 grams of sugar alcohol, 9 grams of other carbs which is what? and 20 grams of protein.Don't bother with this bar. It was better than a protein bar in taste but not as good as a candy bar.  Opt for a reeces instead.
Ok, being completely honest, here, I have to say I am really glad that this peanut butter bar was a free sample and not something I paid for. I really didn't care for it at all. I cut it into several pieces so my wife and children could each try some, too. Here are our collective reactions:Me: I haven't tasted anything like this since the time I snuck one of my mom's "diet" candy bars when I was a kid.My wife: I'm glad I didn't have to eat the whole thing.Daughter: I thought the peanut butter was supposed to be creamy.Son #1: This is like a Reese's peanut butter cup but without the taste. Why doesn't it have more chocolate on it?Son #2: Do I have to eat this whole piece?Yep. None of us liked it. I didn't give it one star, because I recognize the fact that it is made to be a healthy food/energy bar. It does serve this function. I couldn't give it more than two stars, though, because it just doesn't taste very good. Though the flavor is "creamy peanut butter," that doesn't describe it very well. Though there is peanut butter taste, it tastes artificial, and the texture would be much better described as "mealy" than creamy or even chewy. It is a very dry snack bar that will certainly drive you to get a glass of water to wash it down. The "chocolate that isn't exactly chocolate" outer coating is about as thick as the foil wrapper it is wrapped in.Nope. Didn't care for it. Not something I would ever pay money for.
Who says healthy products should taste lousy?  This chunky peanut butter bar had no chunks and the peanut butter was like a bland mousse.  The think chocolate coating was a nice touch but didn't add anything to the bar.  It may provide protein and be gluten free but I would not purchase this bar to maintain my weight when there are better tasting ones out there.
I received a free sample bar from Amazon Vine, and after tasting it I would not buy the product. At first bite, my feeling was that the bar had the scent and flavor of a tasty peanut butter cookie. The center was relatively soft but chewy, and the bar was covered with a thin chocolatey coating. However, as I was chewing the bar I began to detect a distinct bitter aftertaste that got worse as I continued to chew it and remained in my mouth after swallowing. I asked my husband and teenaged son to take a bite of it, and they agreed with me 100%. At first my son said, "I like it," while he was chewing, and then an expression of disgust came across his face as he continued," Well, I did at first." My husband said he's purchased other protein bars of this type before and detected the same bitterness. None of us knows what the source of the bitterness is, but it seems to be common to other sugar free high protein bars. If a customer was looking for a bar with no sugar or gluten that packs 240 calories and a whopping 20 grams of protein, he or she might want to try these. But if you are looking for a product that tastes good, keep looking.
The chunks are soy crisp pieces that taste like cardboard in a peanut butter filling that also contains soy (something I try to avoid) that does not taste at all sweet, almost a little bitter. Only the thin chocolate coating has a sweet taste. The principal sweeteners here are glycerin and maltitol. I often get stomach aches from sugar alcohols. I only ate half of this bar and threw the rest away because I didn't like it. Didn't get a stomach ache from the half anyway.Vine only sent 1 bar, which in this case was a good thing.*Looks like the review for both chunky and Creamy are tied together.*OK the Creamy was a little better, peanut butter part still not sweet, but no hint of bitter. I would give it 3 stars, but probably won't buy again.
The texture of this thinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter bar is nice, chewy and soft, but I found it too sweet.  Note: I don't have much of a sweet tooth; I dilute my fruit juice with half water and always request at least half less sweetener than normal in my espresso drinks.  I also noticed a very protein bar flavor; I'm not sure what that taste is, but it's been present in every type of protein bar I've tried.I didn't notice any of the gastrointestinal troubles noted by another reviewer.Overall, this isn't a bar I intend to add to my regular snacks.  I'll just go with a handful of almonds when I'm looking for a protein-heavy nibble.
After a spring and summer filled with counting calories to shed some pounds, I've tried all kinds of different bars, in a few different brands. My favorite is the Kind brand bars, but I've also tried quite a few of the thinkThin flavors as well. However this Brownie Crunch and I do not get along.Besides of flavor, which is not my favorite, I also discovered this version of bar has Maltitol in the ingredients. I have IBS, and even the smallest amount of any kind of artificial sweetener at all puts me in pain for hours, Maltitol included. So between the less than great flavor, the high amount of calories and fat contained in each bar, and the use of Maltitol to sweeten it (causing abdominal pain for those with reactions to artificial sweeteners), this would be my least favorite thinkThin bar of the bunch. My favorite is thethinkThin Crunch White Chocolate Mixed Nuts, which tastes great and doesn't contain Maltitol!
First I have to admit I have never had anything that was gluten free before this.Maybe that is why I actually gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star, it might not be quite as bad as I felt it was if you can not have wheat products. This really was not my cup of tea, it was dry, nearly crumbly, and relatively tasteless. It was supposed to be real chocolatey, it sure missed THAT mark as far as I concerned. This protein energy bar is a meal replacement bar for many people as it contains 240 calories and 80 of those are from fat. IF you can get ONE bar to try, IF you are one of the many people having to eat a gluten free lifestyle, then try ONE...I would not suggest a box of these to anyone. I wanted to like this product, but I really did not.
I tried these out and I had high hopes. I know this isn't going to taste like a fresh baked brownie, that is not the product line. What it tastes like is very dry, and papery. It's almost as if you are chewing on Styrofoam. These made me extremely thirsty and I just didn't care for the taste at all.
I've been sampling a lot of different meal-replacement AKA high-protein bars lately, because I eat a lot of them and I am looking for variety. For me, this bar is a real failure. First and foremost, it is rather dry, and not very sweet. Even though it is supposed to be a "brownie," it only barely resembles one in taste and not at all in texture.As if all that were not bad enough, this bar is sweetened with maltitol. Sugar alcohols have about 70-90% of the sweetness of white sugar, but the body does not digest them, so manufacturers who include them in their products label them "sugar free." Unfortunately, the fact that sugar alcohols cannot be digested means that they lead to offensive, and often painful, bowel distress. And of all the sugar alcohols, maltitol is the absolute worst for producing these symptoms. Since this is a well-known fact, I can't believe anyone selling a bar marketed as "healthy" would include sugar alcohols. What bothers me, as well, is that there is no gain from the pain of the sugar alcohol--this is a very high calorie bar for such a relatively small one: 230 calories!I will not be purchasing this bar again.Ingredients: Calcium Caseinate, Whey Protein Isolate, Soy Protein Isolate, Casein, Glycerin, Maltitol, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate Liquor, Sodium Caseinate, Milk Fat, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Salt, Cocoa Powder, Almonds, Water, Rice Flour, Canola Oil, Sea Salt.
I like the idea of these gluten free brownie bars.  Unfortunately, they just did not taste that good.  They were dry, and did not have much of a chocolatey taste to them.  It just is not an impressive tasting product.
I wanted to try this product because I have been looking for a good meal supplement or replacement.mthe one good thing about this flavor was the weight: it was a large portion. However, the consistency, taste, and texture were all very poor. I was very disappointed, and do not recommend this flavor of thinkThin bars.
Things like protein bars are typically more convenient than palatable, and the thinkThin Brownie Crunch bar is no exception.  It has a dry, grainy, damp cardboard quality, and the flavor is more chocolate-ish than actual chocolate.  Honestly, the problem here is simply that when you make a low-this or free-of-the-other product that is also supposed to be high in the things that are good for you, mostly you're going to end up with flavored cardboard.So unless you're trapped on the moon with only a carton of these things to hold you until NASA comes to fetch you, I'd say, take the hit and eat real food.  Just eat less of it.
I am a long time user ofSecret Invisible Solid Unscented Antiperspirant & Deodorant Ph BalancedandSecret Flawless Clear Antiperspirant/Deodorant, Crystal Clear Gel, Unscented,I was eager to try Dove gosleeveless and compare the two.  Just like the Secret brand, the Dove had no scent I could detect.  It glided on easily with no crumbling.  I quickly noticed after applying it, it left a white residue on my armpits.  There was also some smeared on the rim of the container.I also was a bit confused about the writing on the label.  What do they mean by "Go sleeveless in 5 days" on the cap?  At first I thought after 5 days of use maybe the deodorant is suppose to last longer than one day, maybe it helps reduce shaving - what did it mean?  I decided to read the back of the label to see if it explained what it might mean.  The item description on Amazon states 24 hours of protection and the back label on the container states 48 hours of protection.  I guess that might be possible if you only shower/bath every other day!  I still don't understand what it stands for.As an antiperspirant it did do it's job and there was no wetness or smell. I will continue to use this product with lighter colored clothing until it is gone but will go back to Secret.It is misleading and false advertising in my opinion.
I am not pleased with this product. It has light scent but there is a definitely smell to it. It goes on fine and it not irritating. It is comfortable of freshly shaved skin. It did leave marks on my black shirt but overall it hasn't been a big deal.What is a big deal is that I am sweaty and stinky. It just doesn't work as well as other antiperspirants.I would be mortified to go sleeveless with a giant wet pit stain. And on top of that, there is no odor control. I have enough things to be self conscious about without smelling bad. Don't we all?
I used this before I went to the gym. I have to say that it did not work that well. First it does not smell that great. After two hours at the gym I can see the pit stains as well as my underarms sweating. This did absolutly nothing for me at the gym. After I took off my sweats  I still seen some residue on my clothing from this. I give it two stars because you can wear it for a few hours not working out.
There's a sticker on this deodorant that says "Go Sleeveless in 5 Days."  Dove ought to rethink that pitch, because I want to go sleeveless right away.Really, I'm not sure what is taking 5 days.  It has moisturizers to make the underarms smoother.  If there was anything I had to moisturize, it's not my underarms.I shower every day, so I can't test the 48 hour protection claim.  I'm not sure I want to.  I hate to admit it, but I do smell a little after a long day of strenuous activity, even with that 48 hour protection.  I'd say it works as well as most deodorants do.  48 hours is a stretch.What I like most is this deodorant stick is truly fragrance free.  Not only do they not add perfumes, the deodorant itself has no scent.  I can't smell it at all.  I love it because my clothes don't have that strong deodorant scent.  That really ought to be the selling point._____________________UPDATE 8/30/13: I put Dove deodorant away for awhile and just started using it again. My husband finally broke down and told me I've been smelly for the past two weeks and that it's never been a problem before. Hmmm. I'd better switch deodorants.
I found this version of Dove quite disappointing. I don't perspire much but this product did not keep my underarms dry. To me, that is the first thing an anti-perspirant, deodorant should do, not make my armpits lovely, but keep them dry. I far preferDove Invisible Solids, Sensitive Skin,which is unscented, does not stain my clothes or skin and keeps me dry.
**This is a side-by-side comparison of Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate and nine leading omega-3 fish oil supplements: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold, Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil, Now Ultra Omega-3, Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega, and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3.Normally, I would give almost any Kirkland product high marks, but its fish oil product is disappointing, other than the fact that it is inexpensive. The product sells for around $16.00 on Amazon, for 400 1000 mg gel caps. You can get it at Costco for much less! The label indicates that each 1000 mg gel cap contains 300 mgs of omega-3. However, there is no indication what portion of that is EPA, DHA, or "other." I spoke with the manufacturer, U.S. Nutrition, who confirmed that roughly 150 mgs is EPA, 80 mgs is DHA, and 70 mgs is "other." As for the remaining 700 mgs, it's nothing beneficial.There are three major components of omega-3 in these products: EPA (which is good for your heart, circulatory system, lowering triglycerides, depression and mood orientation, and is a powerful anti-inflammatory for soothing joint pains), DHA (which is good for your mental acuity, or if you are pregnant, nursing an infant, or for children), and "other." Other omega-3s, like DPA and SDA, are types of fatty acids which are easily converted to EPA in the body. In most fish oils, the amount of these other fatty acids is low, but in highly concentrated oils, it can be a significant amount. The important components are EPA and DHA.I have compared Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate with nine other fish oil supplements. This comparison will reflect that the Kirkland product is not a good product.BREAKDOWN: Here is a breakdown of these supplements.OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (See,OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, 1300 mg Enteric Burp-Free Capsule (1105 mg Omega-3/pill) 60 Capsules)Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$28.89 for 60 1300 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1-4 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.48 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.44 (using Amazon's price)One 1300 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 780 mgsDHA = 260 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 65 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1105 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 85%No soyNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledEnteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 270-4010Manufactured in the U.S.A.Ingredients: pharmaceutical grade fish oil (from sustainably sourced pollock and whiting from Alaska), Kosher gelatin, glycerin, plant-derived natural food glaze (enteric coated to improve absorption and prevent burps), and mixed natural tocopherolsNutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (See,Nutrigold Triple Strength Omega-3 Gold (1,060 mg Omega-3s per softgel), 1250 mg, 180 softgels)Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$36.99 for 180 1250 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1 gel capPrice per gel cap = $.21 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.19 (using Amazon's price)One 1250 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 750 mgsDHA = 250 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 60 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1060 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 85%Soy allergen freeNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledNot enteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 476-3542Manufactured in the U.S.A.Ingredients: pharmaceutical grade purified fish oil (from certified sustainable wild-caught pacific cod and pollock from Alaskan waters), softgel capsule (bovine gelatin, vegetable glycerin, purified water), and natural mixed tocopherolsGarden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (See,Garden of Life - Minami MorEPA Platinum, Plus Vitamin D3 Supercritical Omega 3 Fish Oil, Orange, 30 softgels)Ethyl Esters formNot Certified KosherCertified Halal$16.43 for 30 1218 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1 gel capPrice per gel cap = $.55 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.51 (using Amazon's price)One 1218 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 756 mgsDHA = 228 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 3 to 1Other Omega-3 = 96 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 1080 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 89%Contains soyNo GMOsNo cholesterolNo mercurySupercritical Dual-Process CO2 TechnologyNot enteric coatedNot VegetarianVitamin D3 = 300 I.U.IFOS Rating = Not ratedPhone Number: (866) 465-0051Manufactured and Encapsulated in BelgiumIngredients: pharmaceutical grade fish oil (from anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and herring), gelatin, glycerin, purified water, natural orange flavor, soy lecithin, mixed tocopherolsNorwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (See,Norwegian Gold Super Critical Omega, 30-Count)Ethyl Esters formNot certified Kosher or Halal$25.49 for 30 1200 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 1-2 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.85 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.92 (using Amazon's price)One 1200 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 800 mgsDHA = 124 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 924 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 77%Lipase = 4 mgs (fat digesting enzyme)No soyNo GMOsContains cholesterolNo mercurySupercritical Dual-Process CO2 TechnologyEnteric coatedVegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Vitamin D3 = 1000 I.U.Phone Number: (800) 830-1800Manufactured in CanadaIngredients: fish oil (from anchovies and sardines), fish gelatin, glycerin, beeswax, natural orange flavor, natural caramel color, sunflower lecithin, mixed vitamin E tocopherols (natural flavor protectors), and enteric coatingNordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (See,Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, 1,000 mg Fish Oil, 180 Soft Gels)Triglycerides formNot certified Kosher or Halal$45.25 for 180 1000 mg gel caps on AmazonRecommended Serving: 2 gel capsPrice per gel cap = $.25 (using Amazon's price)Price per 1000 mgs omega-3 = $.39 (using Amazon's price)One 1000 mg gel cap contains a total of:EPA = 325 mgsDHA = 225 mgsEPA/DHA ratio = 1.5 to 1Other Omega-3 = 90 mgsTotal Omega-3 = 640 mgsPercentage Omega-3 per gel cap = 64%No soyNo GMOsContains cholesterolNo mercuryMolecularly distilledNot enteric coatedNot vegetarianIFOS Rating = ***** (five stars, top rating)Phone Number: (800) 662-2544Encapsulated in the U.S.A.Ingredients: fish oil (from anchovies and sardines), softgel capsule (gelatin, glycerin, water, natural lemon flavor), d-alpha tocopherol, and rosemary extract (a natural preservative)Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (See,OMAPURE Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (1 Bottle;

The reports include a 5-star rating for each product containing greater than 60% concentration of EPA and DHA per gram of fish oil, allowing consumers to compare fish oil products based on their safety, purity and quality. Most of the highly rated omega-3 fish oil products are listed. Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate is not listed or rated as a five star omega-3 fish oil product.LABEL DESCRIPTION: I am favorably impressed when a company understates its product's omega-3 content on the label. OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil typically understates its product's potency on its labels. I have seen IFOS batch test results which place OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil's omega-3 potency as high as 94%, far higher than what is stated on its label. Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega also typically understate their products' omega-3 content on their labels.POTENCY: Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (89%) has the most omega-3 potency of those in the comparison; followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (85%), Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (85%), and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega (85%); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (77%); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 (75%) and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (75%); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (72%); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (64%); and followed by Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate (30%), which has the least omega-3 potency of those in the comparison.PRICE PER PILL: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.85 per gel cap) is the most expensive per pill of those in the comparison; followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.55 per gel cap); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.48 per gel cap); followed by Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega ($.39 per gel cap); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.25 per gel cap) and Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.25 per gel cap); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.21 per gel cap); followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.15 per gel cap); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.13 per gel cap); and followed by Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate ($.04 per gel cap), which is the least expensive per pill of those in the comparison.PRICE PER 1000 MGS OMEGA-3: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.92 per 1000 mgs omega-3) is the most expensive per 1000 mgs omega-3 of those in the comparison; followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.51 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.44 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.39 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.38 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega ($.36 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.19 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.18 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.17 per 1000 mgs omega-3); and followed by Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate ($.12 per 1000 mgs omega-3), which is the least expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in the comparison.PILL SIZE: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (1300 mgs) is the largest pill of those in the comparison; followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (1250 mgs) and Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega (1250 mgs); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (1218 mgs); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (1200 mgs); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (1000 mgs), Now Ultra Omega-3 (1000 mgs), Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (1000 mgs), and Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate  (1000 mgs); and followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (900 mgs), which is the smallest pill of those in the comparison. In terms of size, all of these gel caps are manageable for most folks.SOY CONTENT: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil, Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega, Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3, and and Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate  do not contain soy. Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula and Now Ultra Omega-3 contain soy.GMO CONTENT: None of these supplements contain GMOs.STEARATES: None of these supplements contain stearates.CHOLESTEROL CONTENT: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold, Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula, Now Ultra Omega-3, Barlean's Ideal 3 Omega, and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 do not contain cholesterol. Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil, and Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate contain cholesterol.EPA/DHA RATIO: A high EPA to DHA ratio (more EPA than DHA) is beneficial for mood, inflammation, arthritis, heart and those concerned about their LDL cholesterol. A low EPA to DHA ratio (more DHA than EPA) is beneficial for pregnant/nursing women, children, those concerned about eyes, brain, memory, and those recovering from stroke or brain injury. DHA is mostly valuable for brain development in children 4 and under. After 5 years of age, the higher EPA portion is more important for focus, concentration, and behavior issues like ADHD.ENTERIC COATING: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, Now Ultra Omega-3, Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3, and Innovix Labs Pharma-Grade Omega-3 are some of the few omega-3 fish oil products that are enteric coated. Enteric coating is used to prevent fish oil capsules from being digested in the stomach, which can cause a "fishy reflux." However, this problem is limited to only low grade, poorly manufactured fish oil products. Highly purified fish oil supplements that are manufactured to maintain freshness do not generally produce this fishy reflux, especially if the product is taken with food as recommended. Further, the only people who experience fishy burps from even high quality fish oil supplements are those with sensitive GI tract issues, for whom enteric coating may provide some relief from fishy burps, but may also interfere with absorption of the key nutrients in the supplement.There is some evidence that suggests that enteric coating is not required and may actually hinder or impede proper absorption of omega-3 fish oil. In my view, however, this body of evidence is not conclusive.Bottom line, if you have sensitive GI tract issues and experience fishy burps from omega-3 fish oil supplements, you may want to consider an enteric coated product.SUPERCRITICAL DUAL-PROCESS CO2 TECHNOLOGY: Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula and Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega are not molecularly distilled. They use a proprietary Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 technology which concentrates omega-3s, yielding unique selectivity of one of the most biologically active omega-3 fatty acids - EPA. Using less heat, less repeat processing, and natural carbon dioxide as a solvent, allows these products to reach peak concentrations approximating 100% EPA, omitting superfluous fats and fillers. 400% less heat than molecular distillation is used during the entire process, with no oxygen exposure. Natural CO2 is used as an alternative to organic solvents and protects the final product from oxidation. In my opinion, Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 technology is superior to molecular distillation.VITAMIN D3: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega contains 1000 I.U. of Vitamin D3. Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula contains 300 I.U. of Vitamin D3. I don't believe this is terribly significant, as Vitamin D3 can be purchased for very little money, and lots of folks who take it consume more than 1000 I.U. daily.LIPASE: Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega contains 4 mgs of Lipase, which is a fat digesting enzyme. Most omega-3 fish oil products do not contain Lipase. However, the human body produces more than adequate amounts of Lipase and, therefore, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega reference to its benefits might be somewhat enthusiastic.MEALS: Any ethyl esters based and triglycerides based omega-3 fish oils are best taken with a meal containing some fat, as they are more efficiently absorbed when taken with food.OPINION: Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate is a poor product. It is molecularly distilled, it is soy free, it is GMO free, it is mercury free, and it is extremely inexpensive. On the other hand, it is not IFOS five star rated, it contains cholesterol, it is not enteric coated, it is not vegetarian, it is not certified Kosher, and it has an extremely low omega-3 potency (30%).I'm not impressed with Kirkland Natural Fish Oil Omega-3 Concentrate despite its low cost. I question its effectiveness considering its small amount of total omega-3 and large amount of unspecified material. Common sense tells me that any omega-3 pill that costs $.04 is not very good! In this case, you get what you pay for.Kirkland's failure to identify on its label the components of the 300 mgs of omega-3 and 700 mgs of other unspecified material contained in its gel cap suggests to me that the company does not want to be too specific about the contents of its product. One of its ingredients, gelatin, is sourced from China.RATING:I rated OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil five stars because it is IFOS five star rated, it has one of the highest omega-3 potencies on the market (85%), it is molecularly distilled, it is soy free, it is GMO free, it is cholesterol free, it is mercury free, and it is enteric coated.

I am always looking for a good diet bar or a protein bar that will suffice if I cannot get to eat a meal.  I love good white chocolate but this is not good white chocolate.  The white chocolate was very thin on the outside of this bar (which was mostly cocoa inside)and the texture of the coating was waxy. The inside is dense but not really grainy but just rather tasteless. I think it was sort of bland and not very sweet. I hate to say this but I spit the first bite out.  I decided to give it another try and I did eat the second bite but threw the rest away.  I was hoping for something tasty but its not this one.
Wallis Simpson, the American divorc&eacute;e who dethroned a king, once famously said "You can never be too rich or too thin", a truism that keeps most of us buying lottery tickets and chasing the "perfect" diet.  Our quest to battle our bulge and our busy lifestyle run mostly on full throttle has found many of us turning to protein-enhanced cereals, drinks and snacks and my family is certainly no exception.  Even Grandma eats high-protein cereal these days and one of Grandma's daughters, like many Americans working a part-time job in addition to her full-time one, relies heavily on protein drinks to provide a "meal" on days when she goes straight from one job to the next.  Worse, now that I live alone I find myself forgetting to eat, then realizing that I am super hungry at 10 pm, far too late for dinner. Anything that can provide an instant nutritional fix is more than welcome and since I love white chocolate I was delighted to find thesethinkThin White Chocolate, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15).My sample arrived just as my daughter and I were leaving, so I opened up the bar and broke off a piece for each of us.  I thought it was just enh, with a bit of an aftertaste - something I might eat if it was the only thing around but nothing I would go out of my way for.  My daughter had a much more forceful reaction.  It is a good thing that we were still parked in the driveway because she practically tore the car apart looking for something to spit her mouthful into.  Seriously.  (I don't think I've ever seen her react like that and this is the daughter who actually likes protein drinks!)  Later that evening my son-in-law arrived to carry up the shopping, so I handed him the remainder of the bar to try.  He had about the same reaction that I did - meh with an aftertaste.  None of us found the bar "chocolatey" in any way other than the pseudo-white chocolate coating.I had tried the bar without bothering to look at the ingredients, relying in the manufacturer's statement that the bar is Sugar Free and Gluten Free,  so once I had dug out my reading glasses I had a peek.Let me address that "Sugar Free" business - or as the product page states "No Refined Sugars."  What they really mean is that there are no ingredients that belong to the chemical classification "sugars".  Those are easy to spot as they all end in "ose" - glucose, fructose, lactose and so forth.  These true sugars have 4 calories per gram.WhatthinkThin White Chocolate, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Barsdo contain is a sugar substitute that is chemically what is commonly called a "sugar alcohol."  Sugar alcohols are molecular hybrids.  They are not "alcoholic" in the sense that a shot of bourbon or a glass of wine is alcoholic, but they are still carbohydrates and they still have calories - 1.5 to 3 per gram, depending on the particular sugar alcohol. This particular product contains maltitol.Maltitol is made by a number of companies.  It has 75-90% of the sweetness of sugar and the crystallized form can be measured just like regular sugar in a one-to-one replacement. Maltitol is NOT, however, a "natural" ingredient.  Manufactured from starch (often cornstarch), maltitol is produced by hydrogenation and is every bit as chemically manipulated as "refined" sugar - perhaps more.Because sugar alcohols are not completely absorbed after consumption, diabetics may find that certain certain alcohols have less of an effect on their blood sugar than regular sugars do. Also, mouth bacteria do not metabolize sugar alcohols, resulting in less tooth decay. However, the incomplete absorption of sugar alcohols can also lead to bloating, diarrhea and flatulence. Consumption of too much sugar alcohol can lead to a dumping "laxative" effect.How much is too much?  Outside of the United States many nations require that this possibility be mentioned prominently on the label and even here you may come across a statement like "Do not consume more than 4" on a package of "sugar free" hard candies.  (Pay attention to that!  The results are disastrous!) Generally speaking though, about 30 grams for most people - so two of thesethinkThin White Chocolate, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Bars. No seconds allowed!  Do note that people with certain conditions, including those who have had weight control surgery, should not consume sugar alcohol.Also of nutritional interest - With 9 grams of total fat, 3 grams of which are saturated (not the good kind) fat, these bars are fairly high fat.  They are low in fiber, with a mere 1 gram, and contain 25 grams of carbohydrate.  One bar contains 210 calories as well as 200 mg of sodium.  (By way of comparison, one package of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups contains 240 calories.)Grandma's $0.02 - As you can see from the ingredient list I've pasted below from the original on the manufacturer's website,thinkThin White Chocolate, Gluten Free, 2.1-Ounce Barscontain more than a few ingredients that aren't exactly the sort of thing I keep on my pantry shelf.  I prefer to avoid saturated fat and "manufactured" ingredients to the greatest extent possible and found the flavor of these bars unacceptable.  Not recommended.INGREDIENTS: PROTEIN BLEND (WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, CALCIUM CASEINATE, CASEIN), COATING (MALTITOL, COCOA BUTTER, MILK FAT, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, TOCOPHEROLS), GYLCERIN, MALTITOL, ALMONDS, WATER, COCA SOY CRISPS (SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, ALKALIZED COCOA, TAPIOCA STARCH), CANOLA OIL, ALKALIZED COCOA, SOY LECITHIN, CHOCOLATE, SEA SALT, NATURAL FLAVORS, CHICORY FIBER.CONTAINS: MILK, SOY, ALMONDS.CONTAINS: MILK, SOY, ALMONDS. (duplicate in original)GLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO, gfco.org
The package says "Managing your weight never tasted so good". My wife says "it tastes like bad chocolate cake". It's certainly no dessert bar, and I would prefer a Clif bar any day (some of which are gluten-free). It's edible, but not particularly appealing;  I would describe the contents as tasting something like "damp flavored sawdust". The bars are at least made in the USA.NOTE: This product contains a significant amount of maltitol, a sugar alcohol which many people have issues with, for both dietary (interferes with weight loss?) and other health reasons (look it up). It certainly ain't natural, nor are several of the other main ingredients.Anyway, if you need gluten-free and have no better options, I suppose these might be worth a try. Otherwise, I don't see why someone would seek these out.
The good news is that the White Chocolate thinkThin bar is a dense, tasty meal replacement bar.  I stress "meal replacement"  because at 240 calories it is more than a snack.  The bad thing(s) are the ingredients.  The protein source is all soy.  Yes, I know the majority of energy/meal replacement bars and shakes on the market are Soy based.  I just personally won't ingest it on a regular basis due to a lot of research I have done on the effects of large amounts of soy in the body.  Also, most if not all of the world's soybean crops are GMO.  I much prefer the Kind BarsKIND Fruit & Nut, Variety Pack, 18-Count Barsbecause the only soy used in them is Soy Lecithin which is used as a binder only, not as a protein.  thinkThin also contains canola oil which has also been proven to be destructive.  Coconut oil would be so much more beneficial but of course, Canola oil is cheaper.Yes, it is sugar free.  But the sweetener that is used instead of sugar is Maltitol (a sugar alcohol).  Maltitol is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index so keep that in mind if your blood sugar levels are a concern.  Also keep in mind that although this particular thinkThin product is high in protein, it is NOT low in carbs.  So, if you are on an Atkins type diet, these are not for you.The bars are a good size.  I really couldn't finish an entire bar in one sitting.  If you are out and about and decide to eat one make sure you open the end of the package carefully so you can wrap up the remainder of the bar if you don't finish it.Those that already eat soy and have no issues with it will like thinkThin.I give it two stars only because it is tasty enough.  The company just cheaps out regarding the ingredients.
The bar I tried was supposed to be "white chocolate." I love white chocolate, and this bar tasted nothing like white chocolate. I'm not sure what it did taste like except that I found the taste profoundly unpleasant. One bite, and I'd had enough. I will not be trying other flavors.Of course, tastes differ, and others might find this delightful. However, I don't think they'll do so based on the white chocolate. The bar itself is primarily brown with a thin layer of white on the outside. In fact, that layer is so thin that it does not cover the bar completely. Spots of the brown interior show through in a few spots, and throughout, the white covering is at best translucent, not opaque. Oh well, live and learn.
I tried the  thinkThin White Chocolate, Chocolate Covered Strawberries and the Cookies & Creme  bars and I felt they all tasted pretty much the same.  There is a taste of some sort of chocolate and and some sort of sweetness but neither is well defined. I really was not all that impressed with the flavor of any of them. They did taste a bit better refrigerated.The White Chocolate bars have 240 calories, 9 grams of fat, 3 of which is saturated, 25 carbs and one gram of fiber. There is 20 grams of protein in the bar.The Chocolate Covered Strawberries bars have 200 calories, 7 grams of fat, 3 of which is saturated, 23 carbs and one gram of fiber. There is 15 grams of protein in the bar. I really tried to taste the strawberry flavor but all I tasted was something kinda sweet.Cookies and Creme bars have 230 calories, 7 grams of fat, 3.5 of which is saturated, 25 carbs and one gram of fiber. There are 20 grams of protein in each bar. These bars has less of a defined flavor than the Strawberry ones.For me the taste is not good enough to warrant the calories, fat and carbs in the bars despite the protein. I want something more satisfying.These had no real defined flavor in any of them. There was a protein bar taste that I have seen in other protein bars that I have not liked.Others might like the flavors which is why I gave these two stars. There was nothing wrong with the bars I just did not like the flavors and felt the calories, fat and carbs were substantial for one bar.thinkThin does make some crunch bars which I also reviewed which I loved and I would get again. I reviewed the White Chocolate, Blueberry and Strawberry Apple on Amazon and gave them five stars.
This review is for the "white chocolate" protein bar. It arrived on an 83-degree day and the white chocolate exterior had completely melted into a very sweet goo. Even though the parcel was not in the sun, it melted, so I'm guessing that the coating has a low melting point. Though the texture of the coating was lost and some of the flavor of the coating, there was enough of it to note that it is quite sweet, but lacking in any sense of being real chocolate. It felt more like very artificial frosting. the interior is a brownie-like bar which has a pretty nice chewy texture, but also has a very "chemical" aftertaste from the alchemy that results from a mix variety of the protein powders being incorporated into the formula. On the bright side, it's not overbearingly sweet and does have some cocoa flavor in the main bar itself. Ultimately though, I've had much better tasting protein bars (Nu-go being one of them) from a taste viewpoint and they were lower in calories and fat than this. Note that this this 60-gram bar is 240 calories and 80 are fat calories (1/3 are fat calories).
I ordered these because I'm one of those folks that doesn't like chocolate. I do like white chocolate and the options in protein bars are typically only chocolate or vanilla. These are one of the highest protein bars (20 grams) on the market that I've been able to find that also does not have Sucralose (the chemical name for Splenda - and it causes liver damage and makes me very ill). These have a very similar texture and taste to the vanilla PowerBar - but with chocolate taste. I do not see white chocolate listed in the ingredients, but real chocolate IS listed in the ingredients! I was very aggravated to find this out. Chocolate lovers are not going to be looking for something labeled as white chocolate - but lo and behold, these taste like chocolate! While there is a white coating that may have similar ingredients to white chocolate on the outside, I cannot detect the taste of white chocolate at all. Not a hint. The taste of regular chocolate, however, is overpowering as are other unidentifiable flavors. My husband is a big-time chocoholic and took a bite out of one of these bars and spit it out. I will never order these again. Yuck.
I'm disappointed... Most Atkins bars are pretty good. I've tried 4 or 5 flavors now. This one, I have to say, is by far my least favorite. The sweetness is too intense. Total overkill. It is also a very fake sweet that you can detect right away, so it isn't really satisfying either. Then the brownie is thick and pasty. Not a good mouth feel. Overall, it is more like one of those disgusting chewy protein bars than a indulgent snack bar. Too sweet, chalky, chewy in an unplesant way, and fake sugar taste.If you are considering this, I recommend buyers try another flavor. Something nuttier with less sweetness and chocolate will actually better satisfy your chocolate/sweet tooth. If you like nuts, try the hazelnut one. That one is delicious.I gave this two stars instead of one...because it is still edible. It came in a three box, so I will finish them--one box down, two more to go...gulp >_&lt; However, I'm going to "unsubscribe" from this Fudge Brownie Bar now and never repurchase again. Yuck!
This "ThinkThin" bar is misnamed.  It may be gluten free but it sure is not low calorie.It contains very little fiber.  There are fruit and nut alternatives that have more fiber, less sodium and are much more palatable.230 calories put this in the meal substitute category instead of a snack.The peanut butter flavor is masked by the bitter cocoa and it contains Palm oil, which I do not like.I could not eat more than a couple of bites because the bar is so dry that I had to drink a lot of water.I certainly would not recommend this for children.
DARK CHOCOLATE FUDGE 2 stars:This is the bar I liked the least. I found it had a very chalky flavor, the worse of those I have tried. It is another of the smooth consistency bars (no chunks).It has 20 grams of protein, 240 calories and 8 grams of fat.  This bar contains milk, almonds, and soy.Full nutritional information on ingredient information can be found on the official website for the company.
One of my favorite health bars of all time was from the Clif Nectar line in Cacao, a really delicious chocolate flavor, dense and soft in texture.  My expectations for thinkThin bar may have been set on the high side but nonetheless, it wasn't love at first bite.  I found the dark chocolate flavor a bit lacking with this one, and felt it had something of an unpleasant aftertaste.  It could be that some ingredients in this bar that give it the higher protein content are to blame, as the taste just didn't seem very natural and reminded me of other high protein bars I'd had in the past and found to be unappetizing.  I can't say for sure if eating this bar in the morning was the cause of my migraine I had by 4pm but I'm not very inclined to try the other flavors from thinkThin based on the dark chocolate bar.As for positives, the bar was easy to eat without making much mess.  Since it was very dense and not crumbly, the bar was chewy in texture.  At 200 plus calories in this dark chocolate bar, it was filling enough for me to count as breakfast when I ate it at 9am and kept hunger at bay until lunchtime.
I like chocolate. I love dark chocolate. And Think Thin sounds like a good idea.But this Think Thin Dark Chocolate bar just does not taste like chocolate.Oh, it does have cocoa powder in it -way down on the list of ingredients, after something called cocoa soy crisps (whatever those are). The most prominent ingredient is something called protein blend - defined as containing whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, and calcium caseinate. Sounds good?Not for me. I will trade the 7grams of fat and 26 grams of carbs for a Hershey Dark Chocolate bar, and fill in the 20 g of protein with a grilled chicken breast.
I am always looking for good gluten free items.  Since I love chocolate I was anxious to try this one.  There were some problems with this one.  The first problem came when I tried to read the ingredients.  The Amazon Vine sticker placement was on top of the ingredients portion of the label.  The next came when I read the Nutrition Facts panel.  One of the ingredients is Sugar Alcohol.  This can cause stomach discomfort in some people so beware if you are one.  Then I saw that the bar contains Soy which can also cause problems in some people.  And last but not least it just did not taste that good.  All in all a big disappointment.
If you want a low-calorie/low-sugar protein bar you'd be better served with another product. The thinkThin Dark Chocolate bar is fairly unremarkable, and my wife and I didn't care for it at all. The flavor leaves a lot to be desired. It wasn't sweet (which is fine for me) but while not completely "bad", it wasn't very good and left a very strange aftertaste that in my wife's words made her feel uncomfortable. Inside the chocolate coating the bar was dry and crumbly, which made for rather unpleasant eating. All in all it was not an enjoyable experience. We would not get these again unless there is a serious change to the product.
These health bars are supposed to be a deterrent from eating candy bars and these are full of protein. I was reluctant to try them, but since I grew up loving Tiger's Milk bars, so I decided to give them a try. Unfortunately, I didn't like them at all. The taste was unpleasant, and they were way too thick and hard to chew. If it was up to me to pick a protein bar, I would stick with Tiger's Milk.
This bar tastes ok, but definitely not what I was expecting from a "dark chocolate" bar.  I don't like the texture and there is not nearly enough dark chocolate flavor to hold my interest.  The inside looks a bit like nougat but is much drier.  Pass.
Amazon.com is for some reason duplicating my reviews for two very similar products so I'll do a combo review as this same one will end up on two different flavored ThinkThin Gluten free bars.the Peanut Butter bar tastes great and should tickle the taste buds of anybody and in particular anybody on a gluten free diet...I'd give it 4 starsThe Chocolate Fudge bar tasted more like a Chalk-olate bar and I couldn't rate it more than a 1 star...I hope this helps.
I got this from the Vine Program. It said it was a box of 15, but there was only one. I was a bit upset about that until I tasted it. I couldn't eat it all. It just wasn't appetizing. The chocolate smells good, but the texture is weird. It's like a Fig Newton. The inside is very dry both in terms of moisture and lack of sweetness. It's sugarfree so I didn't expect it to be sweet. I like dark chocolate that is low in sugar, but this didn't have that natural goodness. I can't even describe what this tasted like. It's just weird. It might be better than nothing if you are on a diet and can't eat wheat. Or maybe it will help you lose weight if your choice is to eat this or nothing.
I only had one of these. I like the nutrition and 0 sugars, but it tasted blandly sweet (not chocolaty) and was grainy. I may try other varieties, but this one doesn't bode well. One star for effort (would have been half if I could), one for nutrition. (Not to be indelicate, but it gave me wind. Be advised).
I took these over a period of a couple weeks.  While working out a bit more than usual and taking these, I did lose some weight.  Unfortunately, I cannot contribute the weight loss to these pills.  I honestly did not see any noticeable effect from taking this supplement.  I can't say for sure that it didn't do anything, I just cannot pinpoint any effect it had on me or my metabolism.
After taking all 40 pills over a 20 day period I can only report no effect detected, no measurable weight loss during this time period.Perhaps a longer test is required to see some real results, but at 82 cents a day (or 70 cents a day if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save) I do not intend to fund such an experiment myself.
There really should not be much to it than taking the pills and seeing whether you feel a noticeable difference in energy levels, and that's what I did, except for the last part.I really did not notice any change in energy after taking these pills for approximately two weeks. I did not notice any change to my sleeping patters, no change to how I felt when I woke up in the morning, and no change to my energy level throughout the day. I also did not notice any change to my weight even though I maintained a consistent diet after starting this product.When I tried to figure out what might be causing this (since I'm pretty in tune with my body), I thought perhaps it might have to do with the volume of caffeine that I drink in a day. I'm a big fan of diet soda, and I go through several each day, and have for years. It's possible that I've just become so accustomed to caffeine that the amount in these pills doesn't cause any noticeable energy boost. Also, I regularly take vitamins that contain chromium, Vitamin B, and other elements which are in the product.My concern is that I should not have to completely alter my lifestyle to notice a difference in a pill that claims to be an energy booster. I should be able to take my vitamins as normal, eat as normal, and drink my drinks as normal and see a difference, right? This isn't a blind test where I do nothing but take the pill - it has to integrate into my life and cause a change for me to call it a success.Unfortunately, for me, I noticed no changes, therefore no success.
I have used other TwinLab products in the past and have seen some results, so I was excited when I had the chance to do a test with the Ripped Fuel 5x product.  The good news about this supplement is that it is only a twice a day product (to be taken with meals) and it didn't make me jittery (like some other products do).  Unfortunately, I didn't see any difference in either my weight or my BMI with this version of the TwinLab line.This lack of results may be because the product is not effective or it could be because of other factors.  The problem with reviewing a product like this is that it needs to be taken consistently and in conjunction with a good diet and exercise program.  Therefore, I do not know if the fact that I had a cold for much of my test (which had nothing to do with the product) had an impact on the results because it affected my diet/exercise routine.Since I have effectively used another TwinLab product in the past (I can't recall the exact version), I do have a level of trust in them as a manufacturer.  However, I can only review/report on the results that I had and the results were that I didn't have any.
I tried this product out as best I could. I waited until I would have a full 3 weeks to go to the gym religiously and eat properly. I then followed the dosage instructions to a tee. Unfortunately, I saw and felt very little effect from this supplement. It is a great concept, but it just didn't do anything for me. Not recommended...
This product immediately made my metabolism speed up.I felt nervous and edgy.I found gthat it curbed my appetite and when paired with coffee(which I drink daily twice). The hyper feeling that took over me,pursuaded me to stop .I tried it for one week,and my appetite did decrease. I have always been sensitive to stimulants,and so I elected to not continue as I don't trust big changes in energy levels.I also had trouble winding down to sleep.For others this might be fine,but my instincts told me to stop taking this metabolic accelerator.My abs are not that important to me i guess.
When I've gone to the doctor for colds the last two years, my blood pressure has been high. I've never had that happen before, but they explained that over the counter decongestants can sometimes have that side-effect. The doctors prescribed Flonase instead and it worked wonderfully without raising my blood pressure. You squirt the Flonase into each nostril and that's it.Given that you must have a prescription for Flonase, I hoped that the Good Sense Nasal Spray Sinus would be a viable alternative for me. I have used it a couple of times now for congestion due to allergies and again this week when I had some congestion from a cold. I think it worked OK as a decongestant, but I don't plan to buy this anytime in the future. The applicator was just not easy or comfortable. Where the Flonase simply inserts upright into your nostril and is easily pumped to release a dose, the Good Sense Nasal Spray is clumsy, with a foul tasting liquid going up my nose into my throat.I'd rather go to the doctor or the clinic to get a prescription for Flonase than to try the Good Sense Nasal Spray again.
This nasal spray worked okay. There was no dripping down the back of the throat or bad aftertaste. It is easy to use. The effects only lasted a couple of hours and then my congestion was worse than it was before the spray. I think i will stick to saline nasal spray.
I expected to only have to give a couple drops to my little one, but it calls for a dropper full! Babies can easily aspirate liquids dropped into their mouth, especially when they aren't happy. I felt nervous giving my baby this because she didn't like it, and it was simply a lot of liquid to give her all at once. On the upside, it has the essential dose of vitamin D that my breastfed baby needs. It also includes a lot of other vitamins that she might need as an older baby or toddler, but just isn't necessary as a younger baby. I just wish that it was a couple drops or a smaller quantity to give them.
When we took these stink bombs to our pediatrician, the first thing she said was &#34;why would you want to give your baby those?&#34;  I hadn't really thought of that question.  Of course Vitamin-D drops were recommended, but most of the other vitamins any person would need are passed through the breastmilk and buoyed by continued use of a prenatal vitamin.  While marketed to infant, apparently it just isn't needed and you are torturing your child with a disgusting fluid in the meantime.  I give it the extra star in case your kid has a vitamin deficiency for some reason.
This is a generic baby ibuprofen. Good Sense wants you to compare it to Motrin Infants Drops Berry Flavor, which is also a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -- how they work is still unknown. That comparison is probably apt, and Good Sense might be cheaper overall, however, I am concerned about the artificial dye in this Good Sense product -- D&C; red #40.While I am impresses that this product does not have high fructose corn syrup, it arguably could have corn in xanthan gum. Good Sense's product is gluten and alcohol free, but wouldn't it be fabulous if it also used more natural ingredients overall?
I was raised on Tylenol and that's all I've given my daughter (generic included) My Dad is a Dr. and he recommends Tylenol over Ibuprofen. He's 74 yrs old, so I trust he knows what he's talking about. I contacted my daughters Dr and he told me to use the Tylenol as well. They both said Tylenol is way gentler on the stomach than Ibuprofen.Go google it, better yet, ask your Dr.
Was delighted to get this since our Johnson & Johnson first aid kit was almost out of supplies since we have two very active boys (age 11 & 7) in our household so we're always in need of first aid supplies. When I saw that this was for 25 people with 131 pieces I figured that this would last a really long time. Was I disappointed when I took it out of the Amazon box. For the price that they're asking for this you'd be better off buying your supplies individually and still save money in the long run. I personally would NOT buy this at this price. If it wasn't free from Vine I would have been returning this for a refund.
I'll echo the sentiments of all the other reviewers here. First and foremost, this kit certainly can't begin to treat 25 people. It might POSSIBLY be able to handle twenty five different types of injuries, but if more than a couple people get burns, you're out of luck. That bit of disingenuous marketing should make you wary up front.Secondly, we've used a few of the items in this kit and found them to be of subpar quality. The bandages came off pretty quickly and the scissors didn't cut quite right. We haven't had a chance to test out every part of it but I doubt I'll be impressed.There are so many different options out there and safety is so important that I don't see why you'd risk it with this set.
Other reviewers have said enough (and said it well) about the quality you can expect with this set.Let me just add that after seeing the deluge of negative reviews, I wasn't expecting much from this first aid kit. It didn't meet even my lowered expectations.
131 pieces? technically, yes. you get 50 adhesive bandages (3/4"x3") and 50 alcohol pads. other items are:- 1 cold pack- 2 antiseptic packets- 2 burn cream packets- 4 2"x2" gauze pads- 6 3"x3" gauze pads- 1 elastic bandage- 1 roll of tape (5 yards, 1/2" thick)- 10 latex gloves (so 5 pairs)- 1 scissors- 1 plastic tweezeryou also get a case, first-aid handbook and a registration card. well, the 5 pairs of latex gloves come in 5 resealable plastic bags, so i suppose you can store loose tooth or body part in there. i wish it had some other items like medicines, mask, squeeze bottle, eye wash, roll of gauze, differently sized adhesive bandages like band-aids, baking soda, etc... the first aid handbook describes how to treat various injuries, but this kit isn't adequate to treat them when it could have easily contained more items that wouldn't have cost much more.
I happen to work in an office, where paper-cuts are a daily event and occasionally someone burns themselves on a toaster oven. We go through first Aid supplies like Oprah goes throughSPANX Power Panties Shapewear. To say this kit is for 25 people? is just plain false, and hilarious.To charge (at this time) $36 bucks for this? is internet highway robbery. Its a small kit, and when I received it the sticker on the front wasn't properly put on so it had giant air bubbles in it, so - 10 points there for aesthetics. Open it up and its just all dumped in there, no pockets to organize, no compartments, just thrown in there. 131 Pieces..i only counted 128? Lets break that down:5 pairs of rubber gloves- which is 10 "pieces". cost?GLOVES NITRILE P/F MEDIUM ***G Size: 1006 bucks for 100. 60 cents worth.1 blue pair of tweezers, that couldnt pull out anything if they tried , they are sold for 3 bucks for 10 on amazon.PLASTIC TWEEZER 10/PKG Individualy pack.30 cents.1 ace bandageGrafco Elastic "Ace Type" Bandages - 4"x 5yd - Box/10.90 Cents..if that.50 alcohol prep padsAntiseptic Alcohol Wipe Towelettes Medifirst 50/box$1.5510 Gauze pads.Red Cross First Aid Sterile Gauze Pads, Large-10 count, 4" x 4"$1.00Medical Scissors (very cheap ones) Prestige Medical 4 1/2" Iris Scissors $3.251 tiny roll of tapeJohnson & Johnson All Purpose Cloth Tape, 1/2 Inch 1 roll$1.001 instant ice cold packDynarex Instant Cold Pack, 4 Inches x 5 Inches, 24-Count.50 cents.2 packs of first aid burn cream First aid/burn cream- .9 gm packs- 144 per dispenser box .22 cents2 packs of triple antibiotic HART Health Brand Triple Antibiotic Ointment, 0.5 gm Packet, 144 per Box .22 cents50 band aids Coverlet Latex-Free Adhesive Dressings Strips - 1 inch X 3 Inches,100 / Box $2.801 box Firstaid Kit #10 Plastic Empty 2.35...SO thats only 128 items..with box 129 with a piece of paper telling you HOW to do first aid? 130 (rolls eyes). with a retail worth of MAYBE 14.69 and thats being generous. All of this stuff is super generic, the band aids arent fabric, or waterproof (which you need at work) There isnt enough for 2 people, much less 25.You are better off buying your own stuff, and putting it in an empty box.
I was disappointed with this product on the basis of contents and quality.  While I'm not planning on treating 25 people for cuts and bruises, I was hoping for a first aid kit that would last the active school year and replace the myriad of boxes, jars and bottles in the medicine cabinet. Sadly I can't toss everything yet.There are plenty of bandaids, but they are low quality and there's not a great assortment of sizes (would like a butterfly bandaid or two for those deep cuts.) There are just a few packets of oitnment -- not enough for one badly scraped knee. My kit arrived with the gloves in an open bag - hardly sterile wrapping!I am glad for the box, however.  I've placed my supplies in it and at least the family knows where to find things when I'm not around.

I can tell, you can buy all of these items for less money. The case is way too big for its content. I guess they made it that way, so you can actually go to a store, buy all first aid supplies on your own and put them in the box! There was no hot packs, no eye patches, no even ibuprofen or anything like that...
First, set aside the impressive-sounding claim that this first-aid kit "contains over 131 pieces" -- because 100 of them come simply from 50 alcohol wipes and 50 adhesive bandages (plastic; all one size, 3/4- x 3-in). Most of the remainder come from 10 non-sterile gloves (caution: latex; size: fit my hands, a woman's medium); 10 gauze pads (the smallest and thinnest I've seen, essentially a swirl of loose threads that shed lint); 2 single-dose packets each of triple-antibiotic ointment and burn cream; a plastic tweezer; and at least three prominent notices about how to order replacement stock from PhysiciansCare online.There is a handful of discrete useful items: a tiny roll of paper tape (1/2-in x 5-yd); an instant cold pack (starts ice-cold, becomes cool over an hour); an elastic bandage (2-in x approx. 5-ft); and a small scissors. But where are some bandages of substance? an eyewash? a warming blanket? a breathing barrier for mouth-to-mouth? There's a pamphlet describing 911-level emergency care, which seems out of place in this kit for superficial skin wounds. It's all packaged in a plastic case that's probably the most useful aspect of this product, with tabs to pass one of those little tamper-evident plastic locks through and a carrying handle with holes through which to hang the kit prominently on a wall.Bottom line: these contents, quantities, and sometimes quality aren't sufficient for family use at home or in an office of "25 people" as the manufacturer claims. I recommend looking at other first-aid kits; I more strongly recommend becoming familiar with relevant first-aid standards and compiling your own list of contents, then sourcing them on a quick trip to the first-aid aisle in your pharmacy of choice.
Upon opening Physicians Care's First Aid Kit and examining its contents, I was left sadly underwhelmed. While it boasts it "contains over 131 pieces," it fails to mention that 50 are adhesive bandages and 50 are alcohol wipes, so that leaves just over(?) 31 items in the "other" category. The 31 other pieces in the kit include:1 Instant cold pack (one-time use)1 Elastic bandage1 First aid tape roll (1/2" x 5 yards)1 Pair of scissors1 Pair of plastic tweezers2 Antibiotic packets2 Burn cream packets10 Gauze pads (Two sizes: 2" x 2" & 3" x 3")10 Medical grade latex gloves (which is really five pairs)and they even list the 1 first aid handbook (which, while helpful is basically a folded over pamphlet) and 1 registration card as part of the kit and rounds it off to exactly 131 pieces. Maybe the over is the plastic kit itself?The products range from the mediocre (adhesive bandages) to the pretty good (elastic bandage) to the dismal (tweezers), so quality is a serious issue. The majority of pieces in the kit are mediocre at best and wouldn't help much beyond a small cut. That this is really enough for an office of 25 is highly doubtful. Only two antibiotic packets? You've got to be kidding me. Are having tubes of antibiotic or burn cream not sanitary enough anymore? This is way overpriced for what's inside and I've already found two other first aid kits on Amazon that not only have more inside, they're cheaper or around the same price too (at the time of this review). I'd advise looking elsewhere for a first aid kit for your home or office.
"Physicians Care Office First Aid Kit" is a very basic, no-frills first-aid kit that will barely do the job for the non-discerning shopper. As other reviewers have noted, the cost-benefit ratio is just not there. Shoppers will do far better for themselves if they simply put together their own first-aid kit, so as to include far more useful first-aid supplies that what's included in this kit.
When you read the general manufacturer's description of this item you would think you were getting a solid kit filled to the brim with medical equipment. Something you could pull out in an office emergency. And according to the manufacturer, it is very sturdy to boot as it claims to have a weatherproof seal, wall mountable case etc. Judging by the description, you almost feel like you could affix it to a wall and take comfort knowing that you are prepared for almost any catastrophe.Unfortunately, the kit does not live up to expectations. To start with the basic case is cheaply made with poorly closing clasps. Then there is the most important part - the contents of the case. It is described as having 131 pieces but 50 of these pieces are bandaids! There are teeny tiny amounts of burn and antibiotic ointments and cheap tweezers and scissors.Overall the kit is way over priced. As other reviewers have said, it is grossly inaccurate to describe this as a First Aid Kit for 25 people. You would do better to buy a box of bandaids, some anti-biotic cream, alcohol swabs, gauze pads and ibuprofen. And it would be way cheaper.Look elsewhere for an all in one first aid kit.
This is a very basic office first aid kit. The description claims it would be versatile for home or outdoor use, but not in my opinion. Too much is lacking.Two-thirds of the pieces are bandages and alcohol prep pads. The bandages are decent and very sticky, nothing special but definitely higher quality than I expected. The alcohol prep pads are very small but enough for small cuts. It has two tiny single-use packets of antibiotic ointment and burn cream along with a small roll of first-aid tape. I doubt the plastic tweezers will be useful for much. No butterfly bandages, no aspirin, no gauze roll, no splints.The first aid handbook is nice but again, the bare minimum. I didn't have any problems with the case, everything fits in well and it closes snugly. Looks a little cheap but it works. Good cold pack, elastic bandage, and 5 pairs of gloves. It covers all the basics but just didn't go far enough to meet my expectations for a versatile first aid kit.While this is adequate for an office environment, you might want a bit more out of a first aid kit. For the money, you could probably stop at any pharmacy and put together a better kit. Before you settle on this one, definitely do some shopping around first.
I received this first aid kit from Amazon to review and thankfully spent no money on it (if I had I would be returning it right away!).I find the title and description of this first aid kit to be very misleading. In the actual title it states there is enough for 25 people. In no way is this true. There are only two little packets of burn cream and two little packets of antibiotic cream. There is one ace bandage and a very small roll of flimsy tape. There are 10 gloves but I find this to be misleading as well because there are only 5 SETS of gloves. The case itself is ok but the snap closures are very flimsy and I am sure will break off easily. There are also holes on the handle so that you can hang this first aid kit on the wall. I find that to be a nice feature BUT that would imply you would be able to open in without having to take it off the wall. That is not possible with this case, if you open it while it is hanging everything inside will fall out. Overall this is a very dissapointing and WAY overpriced first aid kit. It does have the basics everyone should have on hand but I wouldn't pay more than $9.99 for it.
This is a very simple first aid kit, meant for very basic daily-life type first aid. But of course, it's being priced like an aid kit of higher level. The only thing in this kit that's 'for 25 people' are the band-aids, as everything else is really just for 1 use and/or person. The materials that come are relatively cheap with minimum variety of size and type. No organization what so ever, in case of an emergency you really shouldnt be searching through your first aid kit for an item.So its not cheap, or high quality therefore i highly recommend you stay away from this product.
1 instant cold pack, 10 latex gloves, 2 sachets each of antibiotics, burn cream, one scissors, one tweezer, 10 gauzes, 1 elastic bandage, 1 tape, 50 simple normal sized stick in bandages, 50 alcohol swipe pads.I don't know how above is comprehensive, or useful, to call it an aid kit for 25 people. And it's not that cheap either. The best quality in this one is the plastic box itself. As soon as you open it, it's disappointing. The quality is also generic of all the components inside it. The box is just what it is, a box, there's not divisions in it, and all the stuff is just thrown into it. Just expecting some niceties since the price is not that low.I think there are better kids available, or can be made, for the price. Just take a look at the top sellers in first aid kids on Amazon. There's something just not jiving up with this one.
I can't really disagree with the rest of the reviews here. The PhysiciansCare Office First Aid Kit is a very basic kit. It has the stuff you'll need for minor cuts and scrapes, but nothing for more advanced problems. The kit might satisfy the OSHA requirements, but I'd hardly call it a complete kit. You could probably assemble a better kit yourself, for less money, with a trip to the dollar store.That said, it's all packed together, and it saves you the time of shopping for all the individual pieces, so I guess what you're paying for here is convenience.If you're a cheap employer who just wants to say you got a kit so your employees will shut up, this is the one to get, I guess. If you want something that will handle more advanced injuries, shop around a bit more.

I've seen many First Aid Kits, and unfortunately this kit falls well short of all of them. First, there is not enough triple antibiotic ointment (2 tiny packets at 1/32 of an ounce each instead of the standard 2 ounce Bacitracin-like tube).  There is also only 2 tiny packets of burn creme (the same tiny size as the antibiotic creme).  Now if this kit was marketed as a personal first aid kit at a very discounted price, maybe these minuscule amounts would be more acceptable, but this kit is labeled as an Office First Aid kit for 25 people, and it is over 35 dollars.  The kit also only has one size of 50 adhesive bandages, and they are relatively small (about 2/3rds the size of your standard BAND-Aid size adhesive bandages).  The medical tape is also a narrow roll with little thickness, and there are 50 alcohol prep pads for sterilization prior to an injection. Why so many alcohol prep pads and almost no antibiotic and burn cremes, and undersized adhesive bandages? Are office workers going to give themselves shots with non-existent hypodermic needles every time they require first aid?  I'm sorry, but this kit makes no sense to me.  There is also no compartmentalization of supplies, and the first aid care giver will have to frantically sort through over 100 pieces of randomly placed medical supplies to assist someone during a potentially stressful, time sensitive crisis situation.  There is also only 5 pairs of gloves in the kit (I think at least 15 pairs would be needed for an adequate office first aid kit).  I think the Physicians Care Office First Aid kit needs a major overhaul to become office worthy.
I don't know where they came up with the idea that this is a first aid kit for 25 people. You could not treat 25 people with this kit. It comes with 5 packs of latex gloves, 10 very skinny gauze pads, 2 tiny, one use packets of "triple antibiotic" creme, 2 tiny, one use packets of "first aid burn creme", a small box of alcohol prep pads, an extremely small roll of first aid tape (maybe 3 feet), a pair of scissors, cheap plastic tweezers, and a small assortment of bandaids. It is the bandaids that make up the bulk of the "113" pieces.You'd be better off putting together your own first aid kit.
I thought I needed a new employee room first aid kit because our last one seemed stripped down to its bones. That was until I received this kit in the mail.When I received this kit I looked into my old first aid case to see how bad it really was. What I saw remaining were the smaller band aids, the cold compress, tape, and a large triangular bandage, eye-wash and eye bandages, gauze pads (a box about 1/2 full) an athletic bandage, some alcohol prep packets, inhalant packets (??) a giant gauze pad and about a half tube of anti bacterial ointment (which, to be fair, may have been an 'after market' addition).Here is what is in this box: 50 band aids, all the same finger-size, 10 gauze pads, 50 tiny alcohol prep pads (for giving shots, or what??), 1 instant cold pack, 1 pair scissors, 1 plastic tweezers, 1 very small disposable packet anti-bacterial, 2 very small disposable packets burn cream, 1 elastic bandage, 5 pairs individually wrapped disposable gloves.This looked like a kit put together by odds and ends left over from a real first aid kit. I'm not sure why anyone would need the 50 alcohol pads-- maybe to go with the 50 small finger-sized band aids?Anyhow, the contents of this box pretty much fit into my old first aid box.Why am I complaining? Because I'm thinking of the last few on-the-job injuries I've had here: cut fingers, but BIG cuts, done with the mandolin slicer or the giant meat cleaver. Both of these cuts have required LOTS of gauze, tape, finished up with an extra large band aid to hold it all together. These were rinsed with lots of clean water-- those tiny alcohol "prep" pads are useless. On one of those cuts we used the instant skin band aids that I have bought and added to my first aid kit (we have also used Superglue once or twice on goodly-sized cuts, but I can understand why that isn't included). I've also used the eyewash equipment that is still in my old kit-- just for getting out pesky bits of hair or dirt, not really an emergency but still very annoying.I think this kit was put together to just fill a spot on a wall in some office lunch room-- not to actually get used in any meaningful way. The first time you tear the top off the one little antibiotic ointment package that is the end of that. You'll have to buy another tube. You'll need to buy some larger band aids to accommodate anything bigger than a little finger.You'd be better off just putting together your own first aid kit and filling it with useful items.About the best thing about this kit is the box which can be hung on the wall quite easily.
I guess I expected more somehow. This is an ok kit but pretty much what anyone could gather out of their medicine cabinet and put in a plastic bag which would save more space than the awkward, cheap case.. Most of the 131 pieces appear to be plastic bandages.
OSHA standard 1910.151 (b)states that an employer must have 'adequate first aid supplies' and the supply list varies with the type of workplace. Although this kit would be what is appropriate for most small offices, it is certainly the bare minimum.The ANSI Z308.1-2003 Minimum Requirements for Workplace First Aid Kits consists of:At least one absorbent compress, 32 sq. in. (81.3 sq. cm.) with no side smaller than 4 in. (10 cm)At least 16 adhesive bandages, 1 in. x 3 in. (2.5 cm x 7.5 cm)One roll of adhesive tape, 5 yd. (457.2 cm) totalAt least ten packets of antiseptic, 0.5g (0.14 fl oz.) applicationsAt least six applications of burn treatments, 0.5 g (0.14 fl. oz.)Two or more pairs of medical exam gloves (latex or non-latex)At least four sterile pads, 3 in. x 3 in. (7.5 x 7.5 cm)One triangular bandage, 40 in. x 40 in. x 56 in. (101 cm x 101 cm x 142 cm)This kit has only 2 burn cream packets and does not have a triangular bandage. The case has holes for easy hanging on a wall, however the entire unit must carefully be taken down prior to opening it, or the contents spill out. That is counter-intuitive to how one would get items from the kit in a hurry during an emergency. Consider another kit, your employees will thank you.
Physicians Care's 25-Person First Aid Kit is a comprehensive first aid kit. It comes in a hard plastic carrying case that secures shut with two snaps. There are screw holes in the handle so that you can easily store it on the wall if desired. There is also an expiration date sticker on the side making it easy to know when you need to replace some of the ointments.Within the kit, you'll find:- 50 Alcohol prep pads- 50 3-inch plastic bandages- 10 latex gloves (So, 5 pairs of gloves)- 6 3-inch gauze pads- 4 2-inch gauze pads- 2 packs of antibiotic cream- 2 packs of burn cream- 1 instant cold pack- 1 First Aid poster- 1 pair of scissors- 1 pair of tweezers- 1 roll of medical tape- 1 ace bandageI'll start with the things I like. The bandages are latex free. To someone with a latex allergy, these bandages are invaluable. I'm not allergic, but I am sensitive to the glue used on many bandages, so I appreciate having the latex-free ones. The case includes a rubber gasket to keep moisture out. That's great if you are storing the kit in a high-humidity area.There are things I feel are missing from the kit and would have to be added: butterfly bandages, a foil-type heat blanket (my last first aid kit included one, so I know they don't take up a lot of space), eye pads, aspirin/pain relievers and different sized bandages for smaller or larger cuts.There are supplies within the kit that seem problematic to me. While it is a durable plastic case, the snaps after opening it and closing it a dozen times are already showing wear. I expect months down the road that those snaps will come loose or break off completely. The tweezers are very bulky and don't feel like the plastic is very durable. The tweezer's ends are too fat to be able to grab a narrow sliver. I'll end up replacing these with a better metal unit. The scissors aren't particularly sharp, but I expect that with an inexpensive pair of scissors. What I wasn't expecting was for the scissor blades to already be tarnishing. These are brand new and to already look tarnished doesn't fill me with hope that they'll last. I'll likely replace them too. Finally, while I like latex-free bandages, they just don't stick as well as Band-Aid, Curad or Nexcare brands. After a couple hours on my daughter's finger, the bandage was falling off.Given the retail price of just over $50, I'd rather spend my money on a quality brand first aid kit. There's a kit Johnson & Johnson puts out that costs less money and contains many of the items I feel is missing from this kit.
I used this product for the same reason I use my other favorite brand, to control my HSV-1 (cold sores on the mouth). Over the counter wipe on products treat the symptoms and rarely work but the main ingredient in Tumeric which is Curcumin, actually treats the problem by preventing the breakout... or after a breakout it clears it right up. But this brand does not contain the essentials needed for proper effectness. Therefore I ended up with two outbreaks back to back. I switched back to my favorite and it cleared right up with no additional breakouts. My fav. brand also works great as an anti-imflammatory, and general antioxidant for my joint and back pain where this brand was only slightly effective because of its low dose.***A study found that low concentrations of curcumin interfere with Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) replication. It inhibited the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to viral DNA, thus inhibiting its transcription.***I use Source Naturals Turmeric 1000 whith curcumin being the active ingredient. Turmeric is difficult to absorb so Bioperine(black pepper fruit extract) and bromelain are added to enhance bioavailability. BioPerine increases the bioavailability of nutritional compounds thus making any product containing Bioperine more superior in effectness than without it.
I have had trouble finding a non-toxic product that removes mold/mildew stains from the grout in my tiled bathtub/shower, and I decided to give this product a try, because it is advertised as being non-toxic.I sprayed on this product, scrubbed the grout using agrout brush, then sprayed the grout again and let it set for half an hour. I came back, sprayed and scrubbed again. Sadly, I noticed minimal difference in the stain. I did it one more time. Again, very little results.I also used this to clean my fiberglass bathtub, and it was equally ineffective removing some stubborn stains.Finally, I used it to clean mold off my shower-curtain liner. Again, a bust.As for the supposed non-toxic fumes, the chemical smell is fairly strong, but I am extremely sensitive to chemicals, and I did not get a headache, which is a good sign that the advertising is not false. I only got mild burning of my eyes. However, to be safe, I also ran myAmaircare Roomaid Air Purifierwhich has a volatile organic compound (VOC) filter.All in all, I'm not impressed with this product.
Like most people mold and mildew is an issue in the bathroom. I usually use tilex  or cleanser which does a reasonable job of handling the mildew problem in the grouty corners of my bath.  I tried this product, and couldn't discern that it did much of anything, except smell like flowers. I want products like this to actually HELP remove the mildew/mold.I sprayed it on, and mildew was still there, hardly changed.  Next I tried the under rim of my toilet. Yep. Spray it on. Yep, mildew still there.I prefer products which actually take care of some of the crud for me. This may do something, but If I still have to scrub a lot, I don't see much difference than using cleanser or cheaper products.
Label is a little misleading. Label says it's safe for the earth (that is very vague. Lava is a naturally occurring geologic event; I wouldn't want it to clean my bathroom. Chlorine, in its natural state, is a poisonous gas. Sodium, in its natural state, is extremely volatile. Put the two together and you have common table salt / Sodium Chloride). The label also says that this product is water soluble (I hope so! I plan on washing my bathroom with water!). The label also says the product is biodegradable. While this all sounds wonderful, there are stern warnings about avoiding getting this product in your eyes (eye irritant) and avoiding swallowing (contact poison control immediately, etc.).So, does it work? Not so well. Straight bleach will get the mold out of the grout, but this product did nothing.This product got the scum off of the bottom of the tub mat after a week, but that didn't really impress me.I would not recommend this product.
I was really hoping that this would be as strong as it claimed and I used it particularly on areas of our bathroom that always get mildew and are tough to clean.  This didn't work any better but it had a horrible smell, like something that had died not just bleach. The smell was so bad that my family came and checked on me as I cleaned.  So if something smells worse and works on as well, which do you think you'd chose?  Not this product.I only had a month to test this so I can't say at this point if what it did clean will stay mildew/mold free for longer.  I'll edit this review if it either does not last as long or lasts longer than my normal product; if I don't edit this, assume it worked just as long as my usual product.
Not so good. For some reason my shower often gets small amounts of black mold, and so I am constantly using products to get rid of it. For years I've used X-14, but it really stinks until it is washed off. So I was quite interested in this product, especially since it claims to be &#34;green&#34;. Well, it might be green, but it doesn't get rid of mold. Smells good, but what's the use if it doesn't work?
Milk thistle is reported to improve liver function, which was its appeal to me. Here's a bit of trivia: in cases of poisoning with Amanita mushrooms, which destroy the liver, milk thistle is the only treatment option.Sadly, Jarrow's Milk Thistle comes in gelatin capsules, which makes no sense. Nutritionally and logistically speaking, there is no reason to have the capsules in gelatin. The only thing that having them in gelatin accomplishes is that it excludes/alianates the vegetarian/vegan/Kosher consumers of vitamins.There has been a lot of research on animal fat and meat affecting our health, I just wish companies like Jarrow would read it and stop needlessly adding it into their products.
While this Milk Thistle formula may be very beneficial to others, I would personally caution each individual to research this product.For some it may prove to be a valuable addition to their vitamin and herbal regimen.For others, it could be uselss and perhaps warranting caution.  Check the Mayo Clinic site for more information.For example, in women...estrogenic effects.Therefore, I would not take this Silymarin Extract.
I thought I'd give these a try after the last time I ran out of the Cascade that I usually use. I had noticed that my sister was using these and I figured if they worked then I wouldn't have to keep getting the Jet Dry too. To try them out I just got the 20 count box and I'm glad that's all I wasted my money on!Now, I have one of the top of the line Sears Kenmore dishwashers that's only 6 years old. When I got it it was the second most expensive one or the third, I cant remember for sure now, but any who, it was over $500. So any who, what I'm trying to say is that my dishwasher ain't no old cheap underpowered thing that you have to wash the dishes before you put them in it. It has worked well with the Cascade Gel, a generic Orange scented Gel, and a couple of others that I cant remember. Being a bachelor and living alone I only run it about once a week at most and some times two weeks since the last time. Depends on how often I just use the paper plates. Any who, I thought with this being basically a powder pressed into a block once its broke down it would act like a slightly abrasive spray sorta like a liquid sandblaster to help get the dishes clean. But actually it doesn't really do much of anything.My usual routine is to run a quick rinse after I load the dishwasher then check to make sure everything staid put and nothing got moved around, turned up so it will hold water, or got down and blocked one of the arms. After running a wash cycle with one of these Finish Powerball Tabs I couldn't tell if I had ran the wash cycle or had only run the quick rinse cycle. And that was with a pretty small load of mostly bowls and glass's. With a greasy frying pan and a glass baking dish I used for one of those box cheesy potato's things and running it on the heavy duty pots and pans cycle it didn't even come close to getting the frying pan or the square glass baking dish clean. Even though the frying pan even has the no stick coating, and its a good one too! Not one of those thin aluminum cheap ones that looses all the coating after the first few times its used and you throw it away within the first year. Any who, its one of the really good no stick frying pans that I've had for about ten years. It looked like it had only gone through a quick rinse and not the longest strongest cycle the dishwasher has. Honestly, the only time that these Finish Poweball Tabs work, is if I also use some other dishwasher detergent with them. I've been using this cheap stuff from WalMart in a orange jug called SUN Automatic Dishwashing Gel with Citrus scent. My dishes now come out nice and clean like they are supposed to! So I just pretend that its adding the Finish Poweball Tabs to the cheap Gel that's getting the job done and not the other way around because I really know that it doesn't make any difference if I use the Finish Powerball tabs with the cheap gel stuff or not. But at least I'm using them up and I guess its better than just throwing them away. Or I guess I could just give them to my sister. She has one of those 30 year old dishwashers that she has to wash the dishes before she puts them in it. Maybe that's why she cant tell they don't really do anything? Any who, I can tell you one thing for sure, I'm never going to waist any more of my money them again!
As an informed consumer, I do require more than anecdotal observations (including my own experience) or a manufacturer's &#34;Clinical Studies&#34; to convince me that something is effective in terms of limiting the duration of a cold. So many factors to consider. So really who can actually say that these work even if one's cold seems shorter...that could be for other reasons.What I can say is that before you take this, you need to carefully read the information on the packaging---there are warnings if you are taking certain types of medication and cautions to consult a physician if you are pregnant or breast feedin. Given these, treating them as if they were a cough drop is clearly NOT a good idea,They did nothing for me in terms of shortening the length of a cold. Moreover, I wasn't fond of the taste or that numbing sensation. But that's just me.Is it worth a try to see if these work for you?  If there are no contraindications for you to take, and you want to spend a few dollars on an experiment, why not? But be careful you don't succumb to the &#34;placebo effect.&#34;Question: How does this product qualify as &#34;homeopathic&#34;? (smallish text in lower left corner) That's like companies (this one included) using &#34;All Natural&#34; on a product. Meanwhile,  this contains corn syrup (the first listed ingredient!), honey, glycine, natural flavors (???) and sucrose.Frankly, I think we're better off drinking hot water with lemon (or tea with lemon), lots of liquids and upping our vitamin c and getting bed rest to lessen the duration of a cold.
It just so happened I was coming down with a cold when these arrived. So, I tried them, but haven't noticed any difference (I can say the same for Zicam, which I also tried).  I don't know that these are any more helpful than just drinking lots of fluids and juices.  What I do know is that these leave an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth, along with a tingling/numbing feel to my tongue.  Perhaps that is the result of being sugar free? I'm unsure, but I won't be trying these again.
I'm not actually convinced that these lozenges do all that much to help a cold once you're actually sick.  I didn't find that they had any great effect on my symptoms, I didn't find that my cold got better any quicker than usual.  On top of that, they were pretty unpleasant to ingest.  Because they're lozenges they're in your mouth for quite some time, and I found them to have a weird, metallic taste.  Also, once finished, my mouth had a tingling/burning sensation that was quite unpleasant.
While the initial flavor of the Sugar Free Wild Cherry Flavor Cold-Eeze is relatively pleasant and cherry-like, the flavor soon becomes nasty and medicinal. It left a film on my tongue and made it feel like I'd burned my tongue. The box notes that the wild cherry flavor is "all natural" and that the lozenges contain "other natural flavors" and that no artificial colors or preservatives are used. Perhaps the sugared version of these lozenges are more palatable--I don't know.The very first Cold-Eeze lozenge I had out of the box had a grainy, very unpleasant texture. The other two I tried had a little bit of the graininess in the center but it wasn't as bothersome as the first one I tried (it should be noted that I could barely endure sucking on 3 of these lozenges over two different days in order to test the taste and mouth feel of the product so that I could write this review).Cold-Eeze is a homeopathic remedy and, according to its packaging, does not cause drowsiness, light-headedness or affect blood pressure. It is said to reduce the duration of the common cold by almost half. Unfortunately, I had just recovered from a terrible cold and upper respiratory bug when I received the Cold-Eeze, so I haven't been able to prove or disprove that theory.Important notes from the packaging:-Do not take Cold-Eeze on an empty stomach to avoid possible minor stomach upset. (see note below for more on this)-Do not eat or drink for 15 minutes after use.-Store in a cool dry place after opening.-Product is gluten free.-Product may product a laxative effect. (See note below for more on this)-Diabetic Warning: sugar replacements may affect blood sugar levels.-If pregnant or breast-feeding, ask a health professional before use.-Children under 12 years of age should consult a health professional before use.NOTE: Aside from natural flavors, the other inactive ingredients listed, and information about them from a web search, follow:Isomalt:"Isomalt is a sugar substitute, a type of sugar alcohol, used primarily for its sugar-like physical properties. It has only a small impact on blood sugar levels and does not promote tooth decay. Its energy value is 2 kcal/g, half that of sugars.[1] However, like most sugar alcohols (with the exception of erythritol), it carries a risk of gastric distress, including flatulence and diarrhea, when consumed in large quantities. Therefore, isomalt is advised to not be consumed in quantities larger than about 50 g per day for adults and 25 g for children. Isomalt may prove upsetting to the intestinal tract because the body treats it as a dietary fiber instead of as a simple carbohydrate. Therefore, like most fibers, it can increase bowel movements, passing through the bowel in virtually undigested form."Acesulfame-K:"What's in it: Acesulfame-K is a potassium salt containing methylene chloride, a known carcinogen.Reported side effects: Long term exposure to methylene chloride can cause nausea, headaches, mood problems, impairment of the liver and kidneys, problems with eyesight and possibly cancer. Acesulfame-K may contribute to hypoglemica.Concerns: Of all artificial sweeteners, acesulfame-K has undergone the least scientific scrutiny. Early studies showed a potential link between the sweetener and development of multiple cancers in laboratory animals."Glycine:"a nonessential amino acid occurring in most proteins that acts as a neurotransmitter; aminoacetic acid"You may think that a lozenge doesn't contain enough of these things to harm you, but the dosage recommended on the box is 6 lozenges per day, taken every 2-4 hours, until all symptoms subside. I have known people to use these lozenges for days, so that can add up to a lot of unnecessary chemicals.Since there are other options out there, like Zicam, which contain the same ingredient (Zinc, or zincum gluconicum), I don't think I would reach for Cold-Eeze the next time I feel a cold coming on.T
I've tried 4 flavors of these Lozenges and I can't stand any of them.  Although they did seem to do the job that they're intended for, I refuse to take them for another cold based on the taste.  I highly dislike them.  Especially the long-lasting after taste.  I'm assuming it's the taste of zinc that I'm tasting and disliking.  When I detected a cold coming on I started taking these and my cold was short lived so my assumption is that these helped reduce the length of that cold.It seems that the majority of the reviewers don't have an issue with the taste as I did.  Since it does seem to help reduce the length of the cold, I would recommend at least giving them a try.  Maybe your taste buds won't be as sensitive as mine were.  Maybe you'll actually enjoy the taste.
We had a cat that passed due to chronic renal failure. In her last weeks of life she could not hold her bladder, so we ended up with a lot of areas needing cleaned. As you know, it is very difficult to get pet odors out of fabrics or carpetting and certain types of cleaners will only make the odor worse or linger.This Resolve for Pet Stains works fairly well. I use alot of it at a time and thoroughly saturate the soiled carpet areas and then go over the area with a carpet shampooer so that I am sure to suck it all out of the carpet. The dingy marks on the carpet were gone and it seems like the urine odor is pretty much gone as well. Keep in mind I did use a steam cleaner though too so I have to think that aided in the results of the Resolve.We ended up adopting 2 more cats from our local Humane League after the first cat passed away. Well one of the newly adopted cats has a digestion problem and throws up - pretty much everyday and sometimes multiple times a day. We are waiting for bloodwork and test results to come back, but in the meantime we have these nasty messes to clean up. The Resolve seems to work  good for these particular messes. It removes all traces of discoloring and there is no odor left behind. The first night this cat was home with us, she had loose stools as well. We woke up the next morning to semi-dry stains on the carpet. Resolve did an ok job with those. I used the Resolve along with the carpet shampooer. I then went over the spots with laundry soap in the shampooer (I always use laundry soap in my shampooer as opposed to the special cleaners - it is cheaper and works terrificly.) The spots and odors were gone.All in all, I am not sure that this particular Resolve product is worth the extra cost. I have been able to get the same and/or better results using my steam cleaner/carpet shampooer and laundry soap, even addidng in a little bit of bleach at times. On a side note, I feel that Resolve products in general have gone down hill over the past few years. I am finding fewer and fewer that actually work well or are worth the cost.
I've been using Cascade gel packs for quite some time and have been happy with those.  When these were offered on Vine, I thought it was a good opportunity to compare.  They seem to do an adequate job of cleaning my dishes and don't leave a residue, though it is suggested that you use Jet Dry to protect against spots & residue.  A bit confusing, because elsewhere the box says "Powershine Formula" with rinse agent to help eliminate spots & film.Edit: 1/9/13  I've noticed quite a bit of film appearing on glass and metal items.  I don't have this problem with Cascade gel packs.
The title says it all.  Dishes come out seeming clean but with the glass you can see that a foggy residue is left behind.  I haven't experienced this with other detergents, including other Finish brand powder-style packs.  My experience of no residue with other detergents is both with and with and without using Jet Dry rinsing agent.Hard to recommend these gel packs over other ones because of the residue.I should note that I didn't have any residue from the packs left in my machine.
We tried these because they were on sale. They don't work well, we find food residue on plates and bowls sometimes and almost always on silverware. We are going back toQuantum Dishwasher Tabs, Blue, 45 Countwhich always do a good job.
The Mediterranean diet, having a glass of preferably red wine each day, and green tea have been highly touted as significantly warding off disease for some time.It does make sense.  This Jarrow Resveratrol `synergistic' delivers that...However, generally I drink green tea and have red wine each day.  So I only took on days that I might have missed this protocol.  It is a difficult tablet to swallow but I got it down.My husband does not drink red wine and he just could not abide getting this tablet down and he said he almost choked a number of times.  Recently observing this, I attempted to take the tablets and realized my own difficulty in swallowing them.They could pose quite a hazard, so I can no longer recommend because of this.If Jarrow could produce a more easily ingested formula....we would try again.
I bought this for the supposed energy that they give.  There was no noticeable difference in my energy levels using this product.
I'm not sure how to evaluate this product, but the first thing that went through my head was how terrible it tasted. The uncoated brown tablets taste quite bad. All the other Jarrows products I've used have a gelatin coating.The actual amount of Resveratol in each tablet is quite small -- 20 mg, as is Pterostilbene -- 5 mg.Vitamin C is everywhere, in unprocessed foods or as additives to drinks and food, and we can get it quite easily. It is not a selling point for me.Take one a day with food or juice. I can't attest to the healthy aging claim. I'll let you know in a few years.
My husband takes resveratrol every day, and I take it occasionally; I decided that now might be the time to incorporate it into my everyday routine.  I popped open the top of the Jarrow bottle.  The brown, fairly smooth tablets are about the size of prenatal vitamins.  I thought, wow, these must have more resveratrol than my husband's smaller capsules.  Wrong.  I compared the two bottles.  The Jarrow formula contains 20 mg of Resveratrol while my husband's contains 100 mg.  To be fair, both formulations contain other antioxidants, including grape seed and grape skin extracts.  When I add those extras together and compare, my husband's formulations still comes out ahead, with 300 mg versus the Jarrow's 250 mg.  But the Jarrow's does go further by adding 100 mg of vitamin c (167% RDA), 200 mg of green tea extract, and 100 mg of Quercetin.  The Jarrow formula would be much better marketed as an antioxidant supplement rather than a resveratrol one.  At the very least, the name should be reversed so that people don't think they are getting a lot of resveratrol:  "Jarrow Synergy with Resveratrol."If you already take a multivitamin or have a diet naturally high in vitamin C, I recommend looking elsewhere for your grape-related antioxidants.  If you want a formula that will contain a mix of ingredients and don't mind taking large tablets, then the Jarrow Synergy might be right for you.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I made a point of not ordering the Jarrow vitamins with DHA with their beautiful promises because I figured that fish oil meant that these could possibly be from fish contaminated by the ongoing radioactive dumping from Fukushima (it's been a couple of years, the place is still leaking and the news veers from reporting that they are dumping to they are considering dumping their heavily irradiated water into the ocean right in front of their plant).So I order this "hu zhang" - then I google and find that it is also known as "Japanese bamboo" and then I realize that "Jarrow" might stand for Japan - Arrow because a lot of overseas brands owned by the Japanese begin in J or N.  When I look at the Jarrow website, I see Taiwanese names and I remember that Taiwanese brands were recently boycotted in China for having majority shareholders of Japanese investors i.e. the Taiwanese origin is just a cover.So I think about it - do I really want to risk it?  I just returned two cartons of organic milk from Stonyfield because they were enhanced with DHA because I finally read the carton when I got home and found (1) Stonyfield's proud statement that their DHA is not derived from fish oil but is plant based but (2) that plant derivative is "algin oil" as in algae as in ocean.  So I returned the milk and was told that they would chuck it because Target doesn't reshelve returned food items.Kudos to Target.I will review the Jarrow tablets for turmeric when they finally arrive but I won't consume these hu zhang tablets at all.p.s. I just googled and there was another earthquake NEAR Fukushima today or yesterday.  Holy Cats!
I've done some research on Resveratrol. It is a great antioxidant and helps slow the aging process preventing/alleviating Alzheimer's, diabetes, and heart disease. Sounds like this is something we should all take daily!  So I ordered a bottle.The recommended daily amount is 500 to 1200 mg TRANS resveratrol depending upon different studies.  These pills contain only 16 mg which means you will need to take the entire bottle in ONE day to get the recommend amount needed. WTH????I've used a few other Jarrow Formulas and they are fabulous. Another reviewer suggested that they do have a resveratrol product that has the recommended dose in it. I will look into that. I hope that Jarrow renames this so as not to confuse the consumer.
I'm generally a fan of Jarrows products, but this one is a bit dubious. The amounts of resveratrol and pterostilbene are very very low, compared to what is known to be an effective dose - and even compared to their other products that have those compounds. So hence the "Synergy" marketing. The several antioxidants in very low amounts are supposed to be much greater than the sum of their parts. Perhaps, but where's the research results to back that up?Check out Jarrow's Trans-Pterostilbene if you're interested in resveratrol. Pterostilbene has much better bioavailability than resveratrol, and seems to be a more powerful antioxidant, based on actually published research.
While this is a great combination, based on some new studies, I'm rethinking it.I was given some Pterostilbene, and while researching it, I've come to the conclusion that it is probably more effective than Resveratrol in terms of being absorbed, and in being helpful for age-related illness, such as Alzheimer's, arthritis, cancer, tissue breakdown, etc.Late in 2012, the Department of Neuroscience at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, released a study with the conclusion that "...our findings indicate that at equivalent and diet-achievable doses pterostilbene is a more potent modulator of cognition and cellular stress than resveratrol, likely driven by increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression and increased lipophilicity due to substitution of hydroxy with methoxy group in pterostilbene." (Neurobiol Aging. 2012 Sep;33(9):2062-71. doi: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.08.015)Then I started looking at some Berkeley studies. Dr. Danica Chen has been doing some amazing research. The USDA's chemist Agnes Rimando, at the Natural Products Utilization Research Laboratory in Oxford, Mississippi, isolated pterostilbene as a grad student at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).She found it to be toxic to a few cancer cell lines, especially breast cancer cells.As a result of her animal studies, she believes that pterostilbene can help lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease.For me, all of the above points to a conclusion that low doses of pterostilbene are probably more effective (and cheaper) than high doses of resveratrol.Find what works for you, and I wish you GREAT health and happiness.
It was on a whim that I decided to try Sustenex.  Oh boy, my muse was off duty that day.I tried Sustenex for two weeks or so and I'm sorry to report I had to stop using it.  My constitution did not respond well.  Lots of gas, upset stomach, acid reflux, and so on--these were a few of the problems I ran into, dead center.I eat quite a bit of fiber, as I read one does need to do that with probiotics.  It didn't seem to help.  I'm glad it worked for others, but I'm staying away from Sustenex.
My husband has a very sensitive stomach, and has had digestive issues most of his life, so when I saw the chance to try this out I thought maybe it would be helpful for him. He dislikes many of the dairy products that contain probiotics (yogurt, cottage cheese and string cheese to name a few) so this seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to try probiotics.Unfortunately, he hasn't noticed any change in his digestive health or sensitivities to foods. He still reported the same heartburn and upset stomachs as before. I don't think we'll bother with probiotics for him again.
While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than "fresh mint" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.
I like the Wintergreen flavor.  At least while I'm using it.  Then something strange happens.  I get this strange feeling in my mouth like you do after getting shots at the dentist.  My mouth doesn't go numb or anything but that feeling you get while you're waiting for it to get numb.  It only lasts for about 5 minutes and it's not a bad feeling, just strange.Other than that, it seems to do it's job and my breath is minty fresh.4/7/13 Update- I've decided not to use this mouthwash anymore.  I have a better way to describe the strange feeling now.  It feels as though you've taken Sore Throat spray that is supposed to numb your throat and sprayed it in your mouth.  I still wouldn't say my mouth actually goes numb but it's borderline.  I don't like the feeling.
First, a small note to Amazon Vine program personnel: There were supposed to be 18 sponges in the sample pack. I got one. Trying ONE of these doesn't really allow me to properly use/test this product. Maybe the one I got was an anomaly. I don't know as I only had one and that's the one I reviewed. This does affect the sampling process.Before using, I read the other reviews and I'm glad I did. With only one to test, I decided NOT to use on dishes but for cleaning our very old, and hard to clean, bathtub. (We don't have a dishwasher and find that even putting sponges in a microwave doesn't necessarily "sanitize" them. Plus I don't like the idea of having a dirty sponge IN the microwave to begin with.)I used the sponge along with a commercial tub-cleaning product (cream). On the plus side, it did help to both distribute and drive the product into the tub surface, which facilitates easier and more effective cleaning. The sponge also makes it easier to rinse off the cleaning product. And, as claimed, it did not scratch the surface.Used about three times before it really started to smell and fall apart.Given what Amazon is charging for an 18 pack, the cost-per-sponge is not very economical given its poor performance. For both cost-per-use and performance, we much prefer the Mr Clean magic erasers. They are sturdy, really do an incredible job of cleaning up stuff that you can't get out with anything else and they don't smell!One expects more from a brand such as 3M.
Applying this one does seem to reduce if not completely eliminate the amount of annoying bugs, at least for a while. There were clearly fewer of them the day following application but, 3 weeks later, we seem to be back to 'normal'. It did rain a lot during this time, to be fair.I am not sure that I am going to use this again, mainly because it doesn't address the root cause of the problem and the effect is temporary. We have lots of hummingbirds, regular birds, butterflies and, little toads on our property and somehow I'm afraid that applying this with some regularity may be disruptive. And, of course, there's the delivery method. Had to struggle a little to make it work.My assessment: it's probably Okay if you are having an immediate 'big problem' but using it could be disruptive, because it appears to be quite effective for a while and using it could be frustrating because of the delivery system design.
You must also attach it to your water hose for water is the propellant making this more work intensive than I would like.  The fact that  have to run out the hose and then attach this and then go through the steps to get it going after a long days work is a turn off. What I wanted was just a wide nozzle spray bottle but nooooooo....Back to the cans and the candles.
My husband uses Cutter Backyard Bug Control spray for the lawn and has been very pleased with the results. Fortunately, he had no issues with the bottle. Application was very easy with little to no mess. His only complaint is that we still have mosquitoes. Since we have had such a wet spring and early summer, perhaps our lawn needs two applications. Not sure. As is, the product did not work. My husband likes this brand, so he is going to give it another try.
Mosquito-borne West Nile Virus is an issue in our area. We're ALL trying to get an early start finding effective products and activities to keep the mosquitoes at bay. This Cutter product has been BOTH confusing and disappointing. I envisioned a simple mode of protection by simply attaching the Cutter Bug Control sprayer bottle to the garden hose and spraying bug troubles away. That didn't happen, the nozzle didn't work well; more dribbler than sprayer.The nozzle issues are still an issue. I used another nozzled jar sprayer that attaches to my hose. This made me wonder IF I was applying the correct concentration the company intended and based their tests on. There's inconsistent information about the length of protection the product provides under PERFECT conditions.  Some Cutter documentation alludes to 8 weeks of protection; an older formula I think. The rate at which the bugs are already reappearing indicate I'll be re-spraying every 2 weeks or so. The first couple days it was obvious fewer bugs were around.The Cutter definitely REDUCED but did not eliminate the bugs. Bug-free didn't happen for me; part nozzle and part formulation maybe. Spraying every 2 weeks or so to protect family and friends from potential West Nile Virus infection is a small effort IF the sprayer worked effectively. With Stage 3, water restrictions in place...water on your day once a week, I do not have the luxury of fiddling around with water and hoses for ineffective coverage/results to try it again TOMORROW and risk a water violation fine.Since spraying ONCE and forgetting about it for the Summer isn't gonna happen for me or anyone else where Summer lasts longer than 2 weeks. I'd consider purchasing this item from a vendor where I could do same-day returns/replacement IF the sprayer doesn't work properly.This is a 2.5 STAR product for me.
I ordered this product and was going to put in our toilet. My plumber-husband told me not too. I read another review that said the septic guy said to use it and their plumber friend said not to so I did a little research myself. The following is some information that I found.The EPA recommends pump-outs on a three- to five-year schedule. Pumping removes the solid waste (sludge) from the septic tank bottom, making room for waste water and incoming sludge. Products such as RID-X are unnecessary, according to the EPA.RID-X is made up of "beneficial bacteria" and enzymes, RID-X is a natural additive that can help break up the solid waste (e.g., toilet paper and grease) in conventional septic systems, according to the manufacturer.The bacteria that clean pathogens from solid and liquid wastes are naturally present in the septic system, so none need to be added, according to the EPA. RID-X claims to replace beneficial bacteria if they have been flushed out by high water use or killed with cleaning products.I also found this warning: If you have an aeration system, RV, French drain or chemical toilet, do not use RID-X. To reduce pumping or RID-X use, don't use a garbage disposal or pour grease down the drain. Never flush trash down a toilet. Conserve water by taking brief showers and doing laundry a little at a time. Don't use chemical cleaners for sinks, toilets, or bathtubs, since they can kill the good bacteria.We have lived in the same house for years and have not used RID-X nor have had to get our tank pumped. My husband, the plumber, says if your field lines are working correctly then the tank won't need pumped either but basically if something isn't broke then don't fix it. Some people have trouble with their lines and tanks and could be from various problems. The balance of good bacteria can be delicate so since we don't have problems I didn't use it. If you already have problems with your system then you may want to give the product a try.
I have used both the Septi packs and the boxed RidX, and I agree that the pacs are more convenient.  However, the boxed powder has some advantages, you can control how much you put in, and it is cheaper.  I like the liquid for these same reasons.  If you are going to use RidX, which one to use should be your personal preference about convenience vs.  cost.However, after flushing this latest batch, I decided it was time to actually take a look at what I am flushing down my toilet.We have lived in a house with a septic system for 15 years, and once experienced a failure of the drain field which had to be dug up and redone.  I have on and off added septic additives, (basically when I thought of it) and have been meaning to actually research the effectiveness of these products so I would make a more informed decision about their use.Research:The RidX site claims that the product "restores the delicate balance of beneficial bacterial (sic) and enzymes that are needed to help keep your system operating at full efficiency".  When reading the FAQs section I learned that the bacteria in Rid X multiply to the maximum level in 2 to 4 days, but it is not known how long it takes for them to break down waste since septic systems vary.I then turned to my university library research data base and did a search on septic tank additives.  Surprisingly there is very little actual scientific research.  There is one study, done in 2008 that found that "Across all maintenance levels, the septic tank additives did not significantly increase total bacterial concentration in the septic systems compared with concentrations in the control" and that the "total mass load of bacteria the control septic systems exceeded the mass of bacteria added via these additives".  The study was done on 28 functioning septic tanks over a 12 month period. Do a search on "septic tank additive impacts on microbial populations" to find this article.There are then many news reports that state that additives are either non beneficial or harmful to septic systems.  However, most of these reports, even those that state research do not include links to the research and I could not find the original documents.I found absolutely no research that found that septic additives help maintain the system.  I contacted  RidX who responded "Thank you for your email regarding Rid-X products. Unfortunately, the information regarding our data and methods is considered proprietary.We appreciate your interest and we regret that we could not be more helpful."If you do a google search on "Septic Tank Maintenance: A Key to Longer Septic System Life" you will find an informative pamphlet on how systems work.This document advises against the use of additives, stating that if they do actually work as advertised (reducing the material in the tank) , then they are causing more material to go into the absorption field thus hastening the failure of the absorption field.It is more costly to fix the leach or absorption field than to pump the tank.  I can vouch for this, tank pumping is under 200 dollars, we spent five thousand redoing the leach field.Conclusion:The basic takeaway from this research is that it is very important to watch what you put down the drain (bleach, grease, non biodegradable wipes, feminine products) and to have the tank pumped regularly.  Your own...um...natural production will replenish the bacteria needed by the septic system.I am going to cease using these additives, due to the lack of research supporting that they are actually effective in decreasing the cost and likelihood of repair to the septic system and the small amount of research indicating that they may be harmful to the leach field.  The evidence is not clear, and frankly I am surprised that Rid X has not commissioned some public university to prove that over the long term using this product will reduce septic problems and costs.Your decision is your own, mine is to stop using any additive products to the septic system.
The Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System appeared to be the best thing since sliced bread! I couldn't wait for my husband and I to try it out (him on his face, me on my legs!).  We both use disposable razors, expensive ones. But we both also experience a very close shave with those razors. I cannot say the same for the Philips Norelco arcitec 1090.There are a lot of features to this unit, including: a flex & pivot action razor head that captures shaved hair within it, a quick clean system where you simply open the razor heads and rinse the hair out with tap water, an electronic on/off button that you can also 'lock out' to prevent accidentally turning it on during travel, a display showing how many minutes of shave time you have left in battery life, an indicator that tells you when to replace the razor head assembly, a precision trimmer, cleaning brush, charging stand, 'power pod', quick recharge of 1 hour, cordless, 2 year warranty, and a 60-day money back guarantee. Whew!This razor claims to lift and shave so that you get a closer shave - this is not what my husband and I experienced.  It claims you need to give it 3 full weeks of devoted shaving only with this unit for it to work it's best - I don't buy that.  Either it gives you a good shave, or it doesn't. We prefer the close shave of a razor over this unit.The trimmer would be better if it would extend further.  It is difficult to manuver around a nose with this short little trimmer.It is very easy to clean. You only need flip the heads open and rinse under the tap. Then let dry before putting the protective cap back on.A wonderful product perhaps for those who are used to an electric razor - and not the close shave of a disposable.  There are many features (as you can see listed above!).  However - I do not recommend it if you are used to a very close shave - this just doesn't provide it.  And for the price - do your homework and see if there is something that provides a closer shave.- 1smileycat :-)NOTE: I will see my dad in a few weeks (a lifelong electric razor user) and I will ask him to try this out and give me his feedback.  I will update my review at that time.UPDATE: 3/2008 (I have tried to post this update for awhile now with no success - let's see if it sticks this time!)  My dad loves this razor! He says he has always used Norelco and this is the best one yet!  He gives it 2 thumbs up!~I mean 5 stars!!
At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can't be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as "Frenzy" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.Even when it's on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.From my (and my husband's) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it's not much more than a pretty face, and isn't for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)Pros:- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.- There's a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it's time to see your Optician right away.- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you're pressed for time and out of charge.- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.- There's a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.Cons:- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men's facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You'll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn't very big.- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don't need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I'm afraid I'll need instant gratification.Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007
It's one of the coolest electric razors I've seen. I bought the 1060 which is the same thing as this one except the display. I couldn't wait to get this one. I love Norelco's products. I bought this shaver and tried it for a couple of weeks and found it delivers a really harsh uncomfortable shave with lots of razor burn which I never got from my other Norelco. I think one reason for the harsh shave is that it doesn't have the floating heads anymore that easily give to the contours of your face, this seems to plow into curves instead and you also don't get the range of pivoting that the previous models have (I noticed this didn't surround my Adams Apple like my 9160XL does it sits flat on it). It gives a decent shave but not a great shave like I was hoping and you have to go over areas many times. I think who ever designed this razor just went for how sleek and cool they could make it look and the function came second. You can get as good of shave with a 8140XL SpeedXL which has the same cutting head technology and gain the comfort and save $120. It just won't look as cool on your counter. I've sent mine back and I just bought a Braun Pulsonic 9595 and it's the best shaver I've ever owned. Sorry Norelco but when I spend $200 dollars I just don't want something that looks good I want it improved too.
I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.
I have purchased clear bags from a number of manufacturers. Clean laundry is folded into them, and after carrying upstairs, If I'm too lazy to remove the contents and place in a dresser (which is 99% of the time), anything I need is easy to see in that clear bag.Now mind you, I was well aware that these low-density bags are only able to hold a very light weight, but problems started as I opened the bag. What was the problem?It wasn't a bag.It was a large piece of plastic sheet that was connected only at the bottom. Since it could not be used as a bag, I put it on the floor  and placed a low quality puppy pad over it. My thinking was that at least I could use it as a liner to keep the floor dry as my little pups used the wee-wee pad.Lets just say the leaky puppy pad had an equally leaky partner in crime.Now, had it actually been a bag, it would be good for what it is...a trash liner for very light paper as the stock photo shows. It may be a 60 gallon bag, but doubt it would hold more than 5 pounds.If UPS or the USPS deliver a large package, and it's raining, they sometimes cover it with a bag like this. Just enough to shield the package, not hefty enough to actually carry the package.If that is what you need these for, and you don't mind the irregulars, they will work well for you.
This said heavy duty..compared to what I don't know.  Definitely not to be confused with a trash bag.  It is easy to see contents and does have a nice pleated type bottom that flattens out to hold more.  Yes, this would be good for an office...you could combine many wastebaskets into this huge bag.  Think of a 55 gal barrel, this is a bit bigger than that!  Actually reminds me of the bag that they put over my drycleaning
I've wet shaved all my life except when I was a teenager, and I've always envied those who just grab an electric shaver, whisk it over their faces, and hit the door, so thought I'd try it. The Braun scored highest in quality and satisfaction, so I got this shaver, the top of the line, and gave it a go. I decided to keep at it for several weeks, since it takes time for the beard to become used to a new way of shaving, but by the time my 30 days in which I could get a full refund were up, I sent it back. As another user noted, I had to shave every which way to get at all close, and my skin felt hot afterward. Finally I pulled out my old Gillette Trac III razor and shaving cream and did a comparison test. The Braun couldn't hold a candle to the closeness and comfort afterward of a wet razor shave. So if you're into electric shavers, this is probably the best on the market, but if you're thinking of switching from wet shaving you might want to think again. The proof is in the feel of your face afterward, and there was really no comparison. I'm back to blades for good.
Most disturbing is the product information on the label.Packaging is huge compared to contents and one has to take 2 capsules to get that 100 mg dose.Rooster Comb...not truly substantiated on label.Did not notice any benefits...will update if results change.
I have taken Hylauronic acid for a while. I have the opportunity to try several brands. The Neocell Hylauronic Acid is a good one. It is odor free and easy to take. I did not read the instructions initially and upset my stomach a little. But when I followed the instructions I had no problems.I was really annoyed though at the dosage information. The bottle lists 100 mg, 60 count. On any standard bottle this would mean that you have 60 capsules that are 100 mg. But this label is designed to be as deceptive as possible. Each capsule is 50 mg. So there are actually 30 doses. The label should either read 100 mg 30 count or  50 mg 60 count.
I followed the directions to a tee taking one capsule twice daily on an empty stomach with plenty of water.  I took several pictures of my face (I'm 50 years old) before I started this regime.  All I can say is that I didn't see any improvement in the saggy, loose skin under my eyes or general fine line/wrinkles around my eyes.  I did see a dramatic improvement ten years ago when I started drinking a lot of water everyday.  This may be why I didn't see too much improvement.  Bottom line; save your money and drink more water (calculate how much you need:  [...] and you will see many health benefits besides less wrinkles.
I ordered these because as an esthetician, I am aware of the benefits of hyaluronic acid on the skin.When I discussed it with the physician I work with, he told me that taking hyaluronic acid orally will not cause any significant changes to the skin because stomach acids will destroy it before it has any chance to work.I decided to take them anyway, figuring it could do no harm.I have fairly decent skin, but as I get older, I am looking to KEEP my skin looking young and healthy to avoid having to do any kind of injections or *gasp* surgery. My doctor was right, though. These did nothing for me. Maybe because one month is just not enough for any results. Whatever the reason, I suggest using skin care products that contain hyaluronic acid in them that can be applied directly to the skin. THIS is the best way to get the full potential out of it.
I've heard of Hyaluronic Acid before and was eager to try it but alas my bottle is empty and I can't report any miracles.To start my regime, I took the recommended one capsule on an empty stomach (first thing after waking up) and then another in the evening (right when I got home from work). I did this daily for about 2 weeks, didn't see any results, so I upped the dose to 2 in the morning and 2 after work. After doing that I noticed that my skin felt a little moister than usual, but the humidity started to increase around that time too, so I really couldn't be certain it was due to the rooster comb. As for my skin, it looked no better and maybe even a little worse than usual.Other supposed benefits include joint pain, which I couldn't really verify or deny, since I don't have any usually and wouldn't notice a difference.OVERALL: While I have no complaints about the capsules themselves or brand - I experienced no discomfort and the capsules are extremely easy to swallow - I just don't have any noticeable benefits to report that would make me want to buy another bottle. I also think the price is a little steep considering you only get 60 capsules.
It's hard to give an honest assessment of something like this: a machine that, supposedly, mimics human touch, or at least aims to be quasi therapeutic.The problem, mainly, is its lack of elegance and subtlety. There's the tacky blue glowing balls, of course---which cheapens the whole experience profoundly (it's like you're sitting with your back against a cheap K-Mart stereo). Then there are the massage balls themselves: rough plastic balls that lack any sort of elegance or softness to them at all. The "massage," if you can call it that, is rough, clumsy and not far reaching (the massage goes nowhere near your neck).In the machine's defense: it's inexpensive, and if you are looking for something to help work out the kinks in your mid back area, in a sado-masochistic sort of way, this machine is not that bad.I did not purchase this item myself, and now that I am possession of it it's safe to say I wouldn't. But for the price, it's not a total loss either. And I can see why some consumers think this is good item FOR THE PRICE. I have to, mostly, agree.But if what you are looking for resembles an actual massage---the touch of another human being, or even an approximation---this isn't it. It's nowhere close.
I am not a big massage fan, but I do enjoy it on Shiatsu setting with heat, but only for upper and lower back segments separately. I find it very uncomfortable when it does my whole back. Also it's not long enough for me (I am nearly six feet tall, hardly a basketball center!). My wife, who does enjoy a massage, notes that it is rather uncomfortable to use (she uses the word "pummeled") but the aftereffect is nice. Also, it would likely get more use if you have a chair that you can dedicate it to. Removing and installing the cushion leads to non-use in our house.
The other unit in the household tried this and it did not prevent the flu at all. The relief was minimal. At least there was no taste. A note for vegetarians and vegans, this had extract of duck liver and heart. So, yeah, not for you.
Whenever I feel a cold or other ailment coming on, I usually use Hyland's homeopathic pills (Hyland's Mercurius Vivus, 30X, 250 Tablets), which can be dissolved under the tongue and, in my case, on an empty stomach.  This spray stuff was a terrible option for me.  The flavor was awful and the spray created a sickening sensation that was compounded by the lingering gross flavor.  I could not take this on an empty stomach.  I nearly threw up each time.  The flavor and its sickness-inducing tendencies made me turn back to Hyland's, which dissolve quickly and never make me sick.  I can't recommend this for anything other than its ease of portability and easy spray application.
While I was not sure what to expect when I took Dr. Garber&#8217;s Anxiety supplement, I was hoping it would be a product that would have a calming effect and help relieve the stresses that life and work bring.This supplement has a moderate herbal flavor and is a bit on the sweet side.  Personally, I could taste the alcohol right off, though at 15% the alcohol is far from overpowering.The first time I took this, I thought that this was going to be the greatest stuff on earth.  The first dose I took seemed to have a wonderful calming effect, similar to having a mixed drink or two without the physical impairments that alcohol can cause.  The supplement seemed to take only a few minutes to work.However, that is the last time I really felt any effect from this supplement. I have taken this supplement multiple times since then and have felt nothing.  I tried taking it daily for a week and stopped for a week and to be honest, I really could not tell a difference.  I thought that perhaps I developed some sort of tolerance to the product so I had my wife try it.  She reported feeling absolutely nothing with this supplement.I am not convinced that it works.  If it does work, overall the effect is so mild that I could not tell the difference.  Personally, if I am feeling stressed, I will stick with Captain Morgan and a can of Coca-Cola.
I received this product and Dr. Garber's FemCycle as part of Amazon's Vine program and was eager to receive it since I love natural remedies. When I first glanced at the ingredients list, I didn't read everything carefully, and just noted that it seemed like it was made from herbs. I used it once, and only then did I notice that the last ingredient listed is HYPOTHALAMUS.I had emailed the company about their FemCycle product since one of the ingredients listed in that product is OVARY, and the person who emailed me back said that the ovary came from cows.  I imagine that the same thing is the case here, and that the hypthalamus comes from cows, too.Since Amazon isn't currently showing the full ingredient list, here it is, as taken from the Dr. Garber's website:Contains a proprietary blend of Fig Tree (Ficus carica) buds; Lime Tree (Tilia tomentosa) buds; Silver Birch (Betula verrucosa) seeds; Lepidolite; Hypothalamus. Other ingredients: Glycerin, Purified Water, 15% Ethanol USP.I hate to mark off a product without giving it a chance to work, but this questionable ingredient makes me not want to give this product a chance. If Amazon had listed the ingredients, I wouldn't have chosen this product to review, but the whole idea of drinking something with animal bits and pieces in it just isn't for me.Other than that, this comes in a nice, thick bottle with a dropper. You're supposed to take 1 ml several times a day by either drinking the fluid or adding it to another liquid. The dropper, however, takes up more than 1 ml, and is very difficult to use in order to get it to 1 ml. It would have been much easier to use if the dropped had been better calibrated.In case it's helpful, I also wanted to share this information I found on the Dr. Garber's website about how to use this product:"Suggested Use: Take Dr. Garber's Natural Solutions for Anxiety throughout the day as needed. Take 1.0 ml (two half droppers) directly by mouth or in a small amount of water twice daily. 1.0 ml (two half droppers) twice daily will usually be sufficient although some will find that more frequent dosing of 4 times or more per day will have a better action. Still others just carry the bottle around with them and take an extra squirt whenever they feel the need to. You can even add several squirts into a small bottle of water and just sip it throughout the day! The amount can be safely increased so take it as often as you need to achieve the desired result. If it applies to your particular situation you may find that taking Dr. Garber's Natural Solutions for Depression as well will produce an even better result. Any of Dr. Garber's formulas may be taken together at the same time.Just mix them together in a glass containing a small amount of water."Since I don't like to ingest animal products, I will most likely be sticking to my Bach's Rescue Remedy, which always works well for me to relieve stress.
Dr. Garber's Natural Solutions EnviroDefense claims to provide natural relief from temporary nasal and sinus congestion, watery eyes, and sneezing.  You take one ml (either directly or in water) twice a day by mouth.  The formula contains Black Currant buds, Briar Rose shoots, Juniper Shoots, Galene(?), and Pineal Gland (? I have no idea what these last two are for, though I know what they are).  It also contains glycerin, purified water, and ethanol.Pros: The taste is not bad, not much of a taste at all. A little fruity.Cons: Does not work for me.  Did not alleviate any of my seasonal allergy symptoms, and had the side effect of giving me a problem swallowing and a mild case of hives.  Had to take a Benedryl about 30 minutes after taking this.  To be fair, I did try this over three days with the same effect each time.  Maybe I am sensitive to one of the ingredients  such as the mysterious Galene or Pineal Gland, since the plants extracts in the ingredients are not amongst my allergy triggers.As the title states, this product was not for me, but seems to work well for the previous reviewers.  I will not be buying this, nor will I use the rest of the product.  Thankfully, I received it from Vine at no cost to myself.
Dr. Garber's FemCycle is a proprietary blend of black currant, briar rose, juniper, galene and pineal gland. Other ingredients are glycerin, purified water and ethanol. I'm a little leery of the ingredients. I'm not crazy about the glycerin, ethanol and pineal gland ingredients. After reading the ingredients, I realize that the taste is from the glycerin and ethanol. Being diabetic, I'm sure that I shouldn't be taking this because either of those may spike my blood sugar. I'm also don't want to be taking pineal glands.
Remember that the FDA has NO federal restrictions on these products or vitamins too. I have bad allergy problems all year around so any relief is a blessing in disquise. Did not notice any pleasant affects from the drops. But it did not taste bad or have a bad aftertaste which is such a problem with alot of these products.
So, it's pretty difficult to tell whether this stuff actually works.  What I can say for sure, is that it does not work well enough for me to give up my regular Zyrtec.  When taken in addition to my regular Zyrtec I don't really notice any additional benefit.  So, I can't really recommend spending the money.
Dr. Garber's FemCycle is a proprietary blend of black currant, juniper, raspberry, Glauconite and ovary.  Other ingredients are glycerin, purified water and ethanol. I'm a little leery of the ingredients. I'm sure that the black currant and raspberry are good for you but I'm not crazy about the glycerin, ethanol and ovary ingredients. Upon taking it, I noticed it has a sweet alcoholic taste like cough syrup. After reading the ingredients, I realize that the taste is from the glycerin and ethanol. Being diabetic, I'm sure that I shouldn't be taking this because either of those may spike my blood sugar. I'm also not sure if I should be eating something's ovaries. For the cost, I'd probably just pass on this one.
Dr. Garber's Natural Solutions FemCycle tastes so terrible that it is very difficult to tell if it works.  If you are able to take it everyday, maybe it will work for you.  The taste is so bad that daily use was not possible.
I received this product as part of Amazon's Vine program and was eager to receive it since I love natural remedies.  When I first glanced at the ingredients list, I didn't read everything carefully, and just noted that it seemed like it was made from herbs.  I used it once, and only then did I notice that the last ingredient listed is OVARY.  I have no idea if that's from an animal product or what, so I emailed the company to ask for more information about that ingredient, and will update my review when I hear back.Here is the full ingredient list:"Contains a proprietary blend of Black Currant (Ribes nigrum) buds; Common Juniper (Juniperus communis) young shoots; Raspberry (Rubus idaeus) young shoots; Glauconite; Ovary.  Other ingredients:  Glycerin, Purified Water, 15% Ethanol USP."In the meantime, I hate to mark off a product without giving it a chance to work, but this questionable ingredient makes me not want to give this product a chance.  If Amazon had listed the ingredients, I wouldn't have chosen this product to review, but the whole idea of drinking something with animal ovaries in it just isn't for me.Other than that, this comes in a nice, thick bottle with a dropper.  You're supposed to take 1 ml several times a day by either drinking the fluid or adding it to another liquid.  The dropper, however, takes up more than 1 ml, and is very difficult to use in order to get it to 1 ml.

Because the female hormonal cycle operates on a monthly cycle, even after menopause, it may require a cycle or two before you notice the full effect of this formula. Any of Dr. Garber's formulas may be taken together at the same time. Just mix them together in a glass containing a small amount of water."UPDATE ON 10-29-13:  I received an email response from the company about the ovary, and here is what they said:  "The ovary ingredient in our FemCycle formula is homeopathically prepared bovine ovarian extract."  So it comes from cow ovaries.
If you can get past the horrid alcohol-cough-syrup taste of this stuff it might eventually do some good. I took one dose and coughed and gagged like I'd just  had a shot of vodka. Blech. Then I read the ingredients list and the last item listed is ovary. Ovary? Seriously? Now I'm drunk and disgusted.
I didn't realize when I ordered some Dr. Garber products that all his products contain glycerin and ethanol which I shouldn't be taking because of dietary restrictions. Other ingredients are Blackberry Vine young shoots, Giant Redwood young shoots, Red Spruce Buds, Calcaire of Versaille and Parathyroid. I don't know how any of those of those are suppose to help in bone health. I can not find research that supports that.I think there are better and much cheaper ways to support bone health.
This is the second Dr. Garber Natural solution that I have tried. The first one I did not care for and have the same response to this product. I got a slight headache after trying it a few times. The taste wasnt too bad but that is the only thing I can say positively about this product. This is a very expensive product too.Try something else!
I'm all for homeopathic remedies. I use Arnica Montana for muscle soreness and Rhus Tox for arthritic knees. Both of these work for me. How can I tell? My muscles aren't as sore and neither are my knees.It's much harder to judge the effectiveness of this bone strength homeopathic remedy.What I like about this product:* It's easy to take. One dropper full in your mouth or mixed with water.* The innocuous taste. It doesn't really have a taste, more like a very slight alcoholic medicinal flavor.I tried to find some studies that showed this product's ingredients and their effect on bone density. I couldn't find anything. That is telling in itself.The only way to see if this product works is to do a very controlled test. Before taking this product, have a bone density test. Take this product for a while (a year?). Have another bone density test. Compare the results.I also believe that we should be doing multiple things to increase bone density:* Good diet, including calcium, Vitamin D and Magnesium.* Weight bearing activities like walking.* Strength training to increase muscle mass.So, for me, the jury is still out on this product. I will check back in a year to see how it worked.I don't think this product will harm your bones, but I'm not convinced that it will help strengthen them either, especially with no scientific evidence to back up the claims. At a minimum, Dr. Garber should be doing some controlled studies on his products.
Cleans teeth very well, but expect to buy a new unit once every 18 months.  My first one had the on/off button wear through and stop working.  Luckily I had bought it at Costco and was able to return it.  My second (current) now has a problem where the brush won't stay on.  Even a new brush pops off every few seconds.  I have cleaned the brush thoroughly and can't see why it's coming off.  Apparently just a quality issue.  And my call to Phillips?  Sorry, your unit is out of warranty and we don't provide support.  Please give us another $150 and we'll talk to you for another year.
