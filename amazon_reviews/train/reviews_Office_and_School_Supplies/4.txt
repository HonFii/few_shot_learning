This is a nice product if you are looking for a quick happy note. I keep them next to my desk to make sure sad notes are not the only ones that go home.
I liked the look of this paper when I saw it online, upon receiving it was surprised by the almost neon look of the stars.  The paper itself was very thin.
This is a good solid homeschool program.  It does take time to set up initially.  (it took me a few hours one evening)  However I think the previous comment found here is extreme. I am not computer savvy and I had no trouble setting up my son's program.  Like anything new it takes a little while to learn your way around.  I  also found that it is very flexible to fit our needs.  (You can easily adjust for sick days, re-assign things etc.)  It does require that your child spend a considerable amount of time on the computer and that is something to consider.  However, if for various reasons you are unable to sit beside your child and teach them, then this program allows them to learn independently AND the program does the grading for you.  There are certainly times in life when this is a life saver!
Needed this for school. The bookstore was selling them for $70. This was much cheaper. Works just fine. Minus 1 star because it came with a partially drained battery, but it was used, so that is expected.
Does a satisfactory job. Compatible with Kent State University systems.
The product has been working great, and really appreciate the fast shipping. Only thing was that the product came in without working batteries. So hence as a customer I wasnt  completely satisfied, but all in all great product.
CDs include all Schweser written notes in PDF form but every page is stenciled with an international phone numer as the source was copy protected.
I was pleased with the look of this product. Only drawback was that I thought the paper could have been a little thicker and sturdier.
There is a newer, 2011, edition of this map now available.  Please see the new edition on Amazon atHilton Head and Beaufort Street Map

I took a half year of Latin back in high school and have had a fascination with the language ever since although I've never gotten around to studying it again. I bought the 2010 version of this calendar and was impressed with it so I was happy when I found the 2013 version at a local store.The 2013 edition continues the simple presentation of Latin phrases with the pronunciation and English translation. Just from flipping through the 2013 edition, the difference this year seems to be more of a focus on classical phrases and figures of speech than conversational phrases as in 2010.  Here are some random examples:2010Munda cubiculum tuum. (Clean your room.)Tuere fratrem tuum. (Keep an eye on your brother.)Satis cibi edisti? (Did you have enough to eat?)2013Alter ego (another self)Ad infinitum (to infinity)Cum grano salis (with a grain of salt)Cogito, ergo sum. (I think, therefore I am.)There are still some conversational phrases but just flipping randomly through it, the overall focus seems to be different.  Still, it's a great supplement for those interested in learning the language and would definitely help with vocabulary.
Really liked this product! Great gift for a Stache Bash!!! Husband loves it & has it on his desk at work :)
I like the other reviewers had much luck with this paper.  The quality is gorgeous, people can't tell that my prints are from a printer and not from a developer.  I have an Epson 890 printer and a Kodak DX3900 3.1 Megapixel camera.I did notice a couple of things, the colors come out much richer than they appear on the screen.  It takes some playing around with the settings on the printer.  Another thing is that prints look a little different right out of the machine then they do when they dry.  And it does say to allow 24 hours to dry.Some advice, cut the prints as you go, otherwise you have a 4 foot long curl and you have to touch all of the prints to seperate them for proper drying.Also the curl is BAD.  They give you a plastic sheet to wrap your photos in to unravel the curls but it takes two or three times to make them lay flat.  Its like a poster, you have to roll it the wrong way to make the curl come out.  I suggest waiting until the photos are dry and rolling them as tight as possible.  Even then the curl isn't completely out for good.  Its out enough to hang them on the wall (I hang mine with only one magnet). The ends curled up again a little after a couple of minutes but its not bad enough to make the photos separate themselves from the wall.The quality is great, the prints are great, if you're going to mount them in frames or an album then you will have no problems.  Even with the curl its not bad enough to make me not buy another roll.
I have used two whole rolls of this in my (new last year) Epson Photo 890 printer.  I printed about ~40 Christmas photos last year and nobody could tell these were not professional prints.You do have to read and remember the procedure to align the paper and the paper handling mechanisms, but that's to be expected.  Also, it takes a little hunting to find the proper settings in all the print dialog setup windows, but it's pretty easy overall.One complaint:  it takes a lot of effort to get the curl out of the prints.
This is great paper for printing 4x6 pictures.  I used it on my 785EPX and also on my 825.  You can't tell the difference between photolab &amp; the printed one. The quality is EXCELLENT.  Unfortunately, you can't get the pictures to lie flat no matter what you do.  I've laid heavy books on the pictures and the still pop-up.  It's easier to use Epson 4 X 6 Borderless Photo Paper, same quality, but the pictures are flat.
I don't think it works that well on most printers, but it works sweet on  the EPSON 440. Plus it isn't all that expensive so if you have the EPSON  440 you should definetly get it. The quality is photo-clear and can match  with most other photo-papers in the market right now!!!
This paper makes your photos look great - especially when printed on an Epson 875 DCS printer! Noone can believe that my prints came from my house - not the developer. My only complaints are that sometimes the paper is hard to feed in to the printer and that it is still rounded after printer. I have solved this by wrapping the paper the opposite direction after the ink is dry and my photos are much less rounded. Otherwise, I would have rated this a perfect 5 stars!
This paper yields a very sharp, high-quality print:  a good choice for wide panoramas.  The curl is bothersome, though, and takes a lot of time and effort to work out.  I don't think I'd choose it for borderless 4x6" prints, say; cut sheets would be easier to deal with.
I use this for card making and for creating gift boxes for jewelry. This stuff works great for what I use it for. It is sturdy yet it can be folded easily.
Although the box containing the transparencies was ripped up, the contents were fine and work great. You can't beat the price or the quality.
This product is great for making copies on a commercial grade copier, not so much for a home copier.  The ink never "dries".  Other than that, I was very happy with this product.
I am only giving this four stars at ths time because I haven't used it for a printer yet.  I do have an all in one printer copier fax and scanner (brother) and I have made copies which works great.  I use this just to write and they erase beautifully.  We use these for homeschool and they serve the purpose for that.  They would work great for any school project or inter office presentation.  I haven't had any problems with smears and have left some for weeks and they wipe off. I have not tried to wipe off anything I have copied onto them just because I usually need this for longer periods of time. I am happy with the purchase and would buy again.
I found these transparency's to be one of the most affordable. They are nice and thick and they work great with laser printers, they dry fast. I attempted to make a copy with my inkjet and it took a lot longer to dry and it just smeared everywhere. Satisfied with my buy though.
Easy to make unique and original luggage tags. Now everyone in my family can have the designs that they wanted.
Bought these to work with our office's new laminating machine.  They are a little thin at 5 mil so we when ahead and ordered a set at 7 mil.
We bought these to make diaper bag tags for the babies at our church.  They worked great!  One caution though- I didn't read the fine print to see that these have to be heat sealed.  You need a high heat laminator to seal these.  They've held up great!  We used Sharpies to write on the back (on top of the plastic) and that has worn off.  That would only matter if you were planning on having blanks to fill in like we did.  Great price!
I bought this since I was planning to have some fun art projects for the kids. I've found more uses for the luggage tags so now I need to buy it in larger quantities.
the tags were good. They did what they were supposed to do. I can use them again. I would buy them again.
They are so inexpensive that you can utilize new ones for every trip if you so desire. They are clear and easy to fit on your luggage
Amazon's listed dimensions for this product are obviously wrong. The correct dimensions are 4.25" x 2.5", according to Fellowes' own website. Unfortunately this is a good deal larger than other blank luggage tags and a bit clunky if you plan to turn a business card into a tag.
I actually bought these for another purpose - to create durable, dripproof tags for all the plumbing valves around my basement and especially the boiler.  They worked great for that purpose - just use Avery business card blanks and your computer.You don't even need the machine that these are made for ... I just used the cardboard carrier supplied, and a clothes iron.These are a good value for what they are, but for actual luggage tags I would look for heavier gauge material, though.  These don't seem like they would stand up to airline handling.
Good, all inclusive product.  Am using for Bag Tags for golf bags for a tournament.  Would get heavier gauge for longer use or as a luggage tag.
Not sure how long these will hold up during airline handling; one trip so far. The plastic is 5mm thick; my sense is that airline handling will prove to require something of more substance - maybe 8mm thickness, but that has yet to be proven or disproven.
I got this as a gift (along with the laminator) for my husband, hoping and praying that it would some how get him a bit more orgainized.  i don't think my idea will work, but he's very happy with the product.  Very useful for a lot of different things.
They were very thin but for the price, I guess they were ok.  There are 50 of them. We wanted ID type luggage tags for a band group traveling to Disney.
I liked the fact that they came promptly and when i did receive them instead of taking them to be laminated, when I put the luggage tag in it, I just had to use an iron at med high heat for few seconds to seal them.  The loop itself was not ideal but it worked out well and I think my wedding guest will enjoy them!
I thought these were self laminating and failed to notice I needed a machine to complete.  Luckily the iron worked just as well.  Perfect for the travelers that need tags quick and easy for business or personal.
Good Product & Price. Product was great and at the right price. Glad we bought it! Would absolutely buy again.
I got everything I was expecting from this purchase. Easy to use, and can use them even without a laminator (I used a medium-warm iron and placed the tag between 2 pieces of cloth to protect the iron and it worked!). Great for business card size.
Used an iron to seal them. Medium heat set it on for about two minutes.  If they warped when cooling I just ironed them and they went flat. Do not iron while sealing, just put the iron down on the top and leave it. I used a piece of cotton between the card and iron.  We had 16 people use them on luggage going to the D.R. and all tags survived.  Couldn't beat the price or the speed it shipped here.Oops the only reason it didn't get five stars was the package (not from the shipping) was damaged and there were not 50 tags in the box.  Not a huge issue since I only needed 30 tags but I purchased a full box.  Hoof Fairy
I LOVE THESE!  It's easy to make these tags using a standard iron.  I have plenty to make various tags for luggage and other random items - and I have plenty of leftovers  to make new ones when we move and have a new address! :)
I have not used these yet but will be soon. I arrange group travel and plan to use the luggage tags for an upcoming group. I am anxious to see how well they hold up.
Wow! Whoever knew a small box could cost so much!!This IS a great box and our little ones do like to open it and find whatever little treasures I hide inside of it from the night before, but GOODNESS, it took me a little while to commit to buying it. I even lifted up the laptop to show my (very handy) husband the image and asked him if he thought he could build one.I finally decided to get it because I knew our children would be very interested in the locks and latches and I'm glad I did. It's a sturdy, well built box.Besides the price, my biggest complaint is: they couldn't have made it look any cuter? Yikes! What a bland looking toy. It's not attractive to the eye at all.Our toddler did decide to stand on it once when it was on it's side and the door caved in a little ways, breaking one of the wooden pieces on the inside. I'm not sure how to describe the way it looked, but I asked my husband to take a look at it and he said the best thing to do would be remove the loose wooden piece altogether, so, he did and now there's just one door that closes too far inward, but no big deal.For a big toddler to stand on the box on its side in the first place and not have the whole side cave in is saying something about it's durability.I'd recommend this toy to anyone with children who love to open things, close things, find things or hide things away....and who doesn't mind paying this price!!
This is really great for presentation package.We have been using this for a long time.
After experimenting with several brands of glossy photo papers, I found that, using an HP 960 Deskjet printer, this gave the best results by far. I spend a lot of time and energy taking and enhancing digital pictures, so my aim is to come close to photo shop quality; I really like the weight, brightness and &quot;feel&quot; of this paper, and the colors are exactly what I expected and planned. I avoided this paper for a while because of the price, and settled on Kodak Ultima Glossy, but curiosity and a good sale got the best of me...glad I tried it! I even printed a family portrait I had taken for friends, and they laughed when I charged only three times the cost of the sheets of paper...expected to pay much more for such a professional-looking product. I now use this exclusively for the important stuff...if the price is right! I took away one star only because of the price...but you DO get what you pay for!
This item was good for the price and quantity. I would purchase it again. It was much cheaper online than at the store
This product was as expected and arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date.  Just a few notes about the product that other might find helpful- there are 100 transparencies in the box and they do not have a sensing strip, so they may not work with some photocopiers.
We use it with dry erase markers in consumable workbooks so I can re-use the book with the next kid since we homeschool. This brand seems to be a little harder to erase and we have to use the expo spray (or anything with rubbing alcohol (like hand sanitizer) to remove the dry erase.
Nothing at all problematic with this paper.  It is fine, could be cheaper but so could I...so I can't say anything about that! But as paper goes it is pretty pretty okay.
I like it because you get the paper and ink together.Canon makes great products that deliver great quality.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to print their pictures at home.
I've seen a few reviews rating this product poorly. Howver, for me, it's worked great for printing business cards. The printer colors are slightly different on the actual card than in Photoshop, but I just adjust in Photoshop until the printout is right, then print away.
The glitter looks great and sticks well even with a glue stick. Its a lot of glitter for the price. I would prefer a simpler cap though. the glitter gets stuck in the ridges in the cap when you pour it out.
Good selection of letters and characters, though I would have appreciated a few more letters and a few less characters.
Just as described, matched the old set perfectly. I will quit providing reviews if these minimum word requirements don't stop.
It was what it stated -one roll missing -- and the other ones are great and already using one in my fax machine now.
The person I purchased these from sent an extra little gift with the package (some crayola markers.) The kids lit up when they saw the paper and the markers. They had a great time with them. Thanks a lot!
These are very good markers. I use them for my calendar. However, the red one seems odd, as it fades a little after applying it. Other than that, these were a good value.
These markers come in a variety of colors. I use them with my role-playing board and the perform and erase very well. They last quite a while.
These are great on the laminated maps, but becareful with some of the darker colors of like the purple on a Cheesex map, they will leave ghosts.
Purchased in combination with Expo Chisel Tip markers for use with Chessex Role Playing Play Mat for development of game projects associated with college class.  Proved effective and performed as desired.
Good for play mats for D&D and other RPG games. They do the job, last quite a bit, and are easily removed. What can I say, solid markers.
Serves the purpose at a very good price!Nice variety of colors and the fine point is perfect for writing.Colors stand out and wipes clean, with no residual.
These work great with gaming mats and (mostly) don't stain. As always, avoid using the cursed red marker and try to finish your combats early so you don't have to leave the map drawn for weeks at a time.
I needed these for overhead use in the classroom and they work just as I remember when I was a kid!  They are good quality and do the job.
These pens are good and they wipe off with a wet rag or paper towel, just like they'er supposed to, so I'm happy.
The wet erase markers were exactly what I thought they would be...wet erase markers. I use them for a perpetual calendar on my fridge.
I thought the markers worked well, but you might need to use a remover to get the marker off.  Colors are vibrant and pretty easy to write with.
I like these markers because they write thinner on our scheduling board for our business. The only downside is that I have to wipe the board with Windex twice over to make sure it all comes off and does not stain the board.
They work well. No problems at all. I use them for my Game Mat (a product from chessex) they all appear and all erase. on it (it is a manilla sort of color) the yellow is difficult to see.
The set I received had two purple markers and no brown marker. Not worth the effort of sending it back, they are working great on my Chessex Megamat.
I  rated this with a 4 star because I have not used them yet.  But I like the looks of the pens and I'm sure they will work fine.
We use these markers everyday in our home school. They are a huge improvement over dry erase markers. If you just write with them they are great. My 7 year old granddaughter likes to color pictures on laminated sheets with them. That can be a bit messy especially when you erase. We use them mainly to write on laminated sheets. You need a wet paper towel to erase but they erase very cleanly and easily unlike dry erase markers which require a lot of elbow grease. Just wish they came in more colors.
As others have said these are very nice for use on Chessex battle mats (egChessex Role Playing Play Mat: MEGAMAT Double-Sided Reversible Mat for RPGs and Miniature Figure Games - 34 1/2in x 48in), and that is what I bought mine for.Some words to the wise, though.The yellow does not show very well against the buff colored mat, the red seems to not dry as quickly as the other colors (but is a better, brighter red than the Staedtler red), and the blue will leave a permanent stain if left on the mat for longer than a week.[EDIT 8/26/13] That week is more like five hours (as confirmed at a convention last weekend). The purple also stained, albeit less heavily, in the same timespan. I recommend you do not use the Vis-a-Vis blue or purple colors on the Chessex Battlemat if staining bothers you.[/EDIT].Also, I found the pen caps sometimes won't park on the ends of the pens while I write/draw with them. Not sure why this is true of some colors and not others.That said, I use these pens in preference to the Staedtler ones recommended by Chessex. The colors seem brighter.[EDIT] I dimwittedly left the cap off my black marker for over an hour recently and it dried up completely. Replacing the cap for a few hours brought the pen back to life, as good as new as far as I could tell. Obviously not recommended behavior, but don't toss that pen you left open before you've left it overnight to recover![/EDIT][EDIT 8/29/13] My black pen ran dry after 11 months of weekly use, so I needed these:Expo Vis-A-Vis Wet Erase Markers, 5 Black Markers (16665B). You will too one day.[/EDIT]
Well constructed, not all colors work well, so there will be some expermintening needed, but it has more colors and might help make a more memorable presentation or when using on 'battle' mats or the like gives more options then the typical rbgr colors.
I usually get the green checks.  I find the green checks better, because you can see and read the printer better.  But, I didn't see any green checks on sale at the time.
Having run a "paper intense" small business for nearly 20 years, I have suffered more than my share of electric staplers. Most cost over $100 and last less than a year. Jams were nearly unavoidable and frequently fatal for the stapler. This is a heavier duty model and unique in that the staples come in a flat roll, not shaped like staples [ until they are actually formed around the paper. So far it has performed very well and is designed so that any packet too thick to ba stapled will not fit in the throat of the stapler, thus avoiding most potential paper jams. I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone willing to spend a bit more for a much better long term experience.
I've had similar Swingline staples in the past.  They work well. Personally, I do not like the bing plastic satey guard but it does the job.
This stapler keeps up with the high traffic and usage in a large corporate law firm.  Have had no problems at all.
This is a large, heavy, well built punch.  I haven't had it for long, but, so far, it works very well, taking little effort to punch through lots of paper.  I do find, however, that upon depressing the handle fully to complete the punch stroke that my hand seems to be a little further down than I had expected, with my knuckles pushing into the stack of paper that I was punching.  This is not a big deal, but it feels a little awkward, so it seems like a bit of a design gaffe.
The punch is nicely made and performs well with large stacks of papers.I replaced an older punch that could only punch about 25 sheets at a time, and the Swingline can punch about twice that.My only complaint is that when punching one or two sheets, the middle hole does not fully punch through and &#34;hangs&#34;, but when punching more sheets at a time it works perfectly.I have not changed any of the settings yet, but the punch can be adjusted for different hole spacing.I really like the handle as it gives you a lot of leverage and makes punching stacks of paper easy. Most other punches require a lot more downward pressure because they do not have a extending handle like the Swingline.I gave this a 4 star because for the price I paid, I expected it to punch one sheet of paper perfectly, which it does not.
I was looking for the exact one at work and it looked like it but when I got it, unfortunately it was not.  This is probably great for a business but for home use its rather heavy and hard to punch down if just using a few pages.  Its great for an office just not for my home.
The guides were easy to adjust for what I needed. I expect to have it for a long time and not have to replace like others.
The product was received in a timely manner.  It was purchased for a faculty member and I have heard no complaints.  It is performing well.
Not so well for the laser printer, toner wont be printed on this paper firmly, you can rub the print easily, might be better to use it on a inkjet printer. Good quality and cheap price.
I was very pleased with how easy it was to use with my little printer but I wish the cost was a little lower or had more paper and ink for the price.
I'm still evaluating but so far it meets my needs: maps for hiking & kayaking.  It's essentially thin plastic sheets.  Doesn't fold easily.  Works well with laser printer.
I installed these grommets in a multimedia rack.  I really like the look of them and they installed snugly.  The only reason for getting 4 instead of 5 stars is that one of the rubber covers started to pull off.  This was caused by the movement of a large gauge wire and plug during my installation.  It doesn't bother me mostly because this particular location is out of sight, but if it were visible it would have been annoying.  I would think twice before using these in a location where you will be changing cords a lot.  If you just install everything and leave it, then you should be ok.
This product works and fits very tight after drilling with the Vulcan Bi Metal Hole Saw that i purchased here. TIP: Before you fully insert the grommet be sure to run your cables first ( if it's for a wall ) because after you insert the grommet you may have a hard time getting it out again.
I had an adjustable hole saw, but it didn't work very well on a test hole in piece of scrap plywood, so I went to the hardware store and bought a 2 3/8" hole saw. I'll probably never use it again, but it was worth it since I drilled 4 holes in our desks (which didn't have cable holes in them). It is too bad it didn't use a 2" or even a 2 1/8" hole (used for door knobs) which I already had. So 1 star off for that.
I install a lot of grommets, and this style is much nicer than the standard, inflexible type.As the other reviewer noted, it is 2 3/8", not 2 1/4" or 2 1/2". That makes finding a hole saw much more difficult. I happen to have one, but I checked at a few hardware stores the other day and didn't find any. You may need to call around for one first. But the benefits of this design make the finished result worth it.
It's a fine grommet for passing cables. But could they not make it in a diameter for which most people have a bit? A standard hole-saw for a door-knob is 2 1/8 inch. So why not make it just a little bit smaller? I used a Rotozip to enlarge the hole, and it wasn't elegant, but the lip covers the butchery
I would give this grommet 5 stars for Durability and Aesthetics, but only 2 stars for Ease of Installation. It requires a particular size of hole saw that is unlikely to be in most people's tool kits. Failing that, the use of a slightly smaller, more standard hole saw mandates some serious work with a rasp.That said, the end result is very clean and functional. I was able to run all the cords coming from my powered USB hub up through the grommet, where they're held for immediate use just by gently pulling them up through the petals. Returning the cords through the grommet requires a bit of guidance, but it's certainly not difficult.All in all, the result was well worth the effort for me!
I purchased this for my son.  He loves playing with trucks so when I saw this, I had to buy it for him.  Good educational game.  He enjoys matching the different trucks.
I homeschool and in my state it is required that I keep attendance. These charts are clearly printed on heavy paper. It was exactly what I was wanting.
Tasco hasn't always been known for quality telescopes, but this one has served me well. I was able to purchase a third party tracking motor for the mount and I have used it to take photos of the Moon, planets, Messier Objects and more (you can see these at [...] My only recommendation would be to get a couple good Plossl eyepieces with it, since the ones that come with it aren't so great.
I use one of these to write in daily. This composition notebook has a hard cover to keep the pages from bending, has 100 pages for you to fill in. Out of the notebooks I have used, these composition ones have been my favorite. So looking for something to doodle in, or write a journal, I suggest this one.
This product came in excellent condition. I think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another. Everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch! The only assembly I had to do was to re-adjust the plastic dividers. I ordered it May 25th and received it May 26th. Very fast shipping!! I'm very pleased.
Perfect for the 3 year old boy I was buying them for. Great for open ended play. Sorting, counting, stacking, lining up. Hours of individual and team fun! I love Learning Resources products for family and my home childcare business!
I have worked in early childhood education for 18 years. These are your standard plastic sorters, good size, well molded... I bought these for my 3.5 year old spectrum son so he could get more experience with colors and patterning before we hit preschool. our only issue with them is that it took forever to figure out what kind of dinosaur is passing for a triceratops. The book that accompanies this gives information on a triceratops and most kids probably wouldnt even notice the counters included only have 2 horns, but my son was insistent that I tell him the right name... Closest we have found was a rubeosaurus, and even thats not right.  I need to go now and spend the day learning about my sons favorite subject again, and thats never a bad thing,,, would deff still buy them if I had a do over : )
Great products...they are made of this kind of rubber, smooth to touch yet durable, almost like the texture of an eraser but more solid. Great to learn to count.
My daughter loves this puppet!  Of the ones we gave her on her birthday, this is her favorite.  It has nice hair, a beautiful dress, and it's small so that a child's hand can fit inside nicely and make the puppet move.
A well made princess puppet, nice details and she's pretty but not too frou frou. I can see her defending herself against the T-Rex puppet I bought at the same time:)
My family loves Folkmanis puppets and this one is no exception.  This princess is lovely, her costume quite luxurious.  The fun is in how you play with puppets of course, so it's just a tool.  For the price, this is a high-quality toy.
I added this to my 3 1/2 year boys' puppet collection to give them a female character among the kings, knight, dragons, lions, etc.  It is very pretty and all of their friends seem to enjoy it.  Well made.  Good for pretend play.
We received our CD changer in record time and it was in excellent shape.  We purchased it to install in our motor home.  It is not going to be easy to install but that's not the fault of the equipment.  Very satisfied with our purchase.
For the money, seems to be a great deal.  The collimating instructions are a bit weak, but the scope seems to be a good beginner one.  I'm in St. Pete, FL, so it's a bit sucky here for good skywatching due to the eleveation and moisture.  Still, some pretty cool stuff in the sky and great for beginners.  See my pic for a sample of what I can see (just put my Canon 7mp camera to the eyepiece and took it - turned out awesome.)
The manufacturers of Oust outdoor scent air sanitizer proudly boast that Oust kills odor causing bacteria as it eliminates odors in your home--and they are right. This easy to use aerosol spray does indeed promptly and permanently remove unpleasant odors in your home.It's easy to use: just spray it in the direction you want it to go for about 10 to 15 seconds. That alone should solve your odor problem; Oust is that potent. Another plus: this type of Oust adds a very pleasant, not too heavy outdoor scent into the air in your room. I love the fresh outdoor scent and I use it as often as I can!Unfortunately, I have to take off one star because this comes in an aerosol spray can; and that can be hazardous to the overall air quality here on planet Earth. Please keep this drawback in mind before you choose to purchase Oust.The manufacturers of Oust provide their customers with both a website and a toll free number should anyone have any questions about Oust. Great customer service!Overall, however, you just can't beat this odor eating spray. It works much more efficiently and quickly than other air fresheners I've used; and the outdoor scent is great. You may spend a little more to buy Oust; but Oust is worth every last penny you'll pay for it. The aerosol can is the only drawback but you get so much use out of the can that you shouldn't be too concerned about this issue.
ANSWER: Grey Poupon mustard is one, that is if you consider "gourmet foods" a potential gift. Well, we all know what "Parker" pens are good for and we can get refills for them anythere from the local stationery store to Wal-Mart. What's more, they are a durable good, unlike the "Grey Poupon," and in High School, I have been informed, that they are still considered a status symbol. For the youngsters on your shopping list, remember this, kids can't bring their Lexuses into the classroom.I have been finding Parker pens in jackets I have not worn in five or six years and they still write. Try that with a Bic! Even "Cross" pens tend to have less durable mechanisms and the plating wears off faster. The set pictured here is one I gave to 6 different people in 1998 for Christmas. The set I kept for myself I keep in my handbag most of the time. It still looks and functions like brand new and when it runs out of ink or lead I just get a refill. As a bonus, with the pencil you can use the standard .07 lead refills which are dirt cheap. [I'm still using the dollar store refills my daughter gave me in 2002.] The only drawback is that no fine point refills seem to be available.Around Christmas, you can usually get this pen and pencil set in a gift box for around $10.00 at stores like Staples, Target, or Office Max. I paid $9 per set including a fancy gift box for each of the sets I bought in 1998. I would definitely recommend this set as a gift for graduates, professionals, office workers, or anyone interested in a classy way to sign his/her name. Don't let this great find pass you by!
This is a nice set for the price.  They are on the heavy side, so if you like a light pen/pencil these are not for you.  The leads are easy to get but does anyone know where to get the eraser refills?  I wear mine out doing crossword puzzles.
I give it a 4 because Amazon, Manufacturer and lister failed to write the dimensions of many Rubbermaid products.Would you like to see dimensions at Amazon?
Great product! I did not look closely at the measurements before purchasing and was pleasantly surprised! These are huge! Can store a great deal of items in them. You do not want to put too much weight inside, but it will hold a bunch of things.
They are very attractive and modern looking. The snaps do come apart fairly easily but not so much when the boxes are full of files. I bought 6 of them to fill an Ikea cube wall unit. The fit is nice and looks really good. My only complaint is the lids are so much bigger than the boxes they do not fit in the cube slot so lids are pointless for my purposes. Overall a great product and cost effective.
They are a good replacement item if you pins break.  They are not a perfect fit, but work well. The center pin on the belt loop bracket fits a little tighter in the post than the originals.
These tabbed dividers were just what I was looking for.  However, I didn't realize that the width of the divider may be different than the width of the pages in my Franklin Covey day planner.  So, once I installed the dividers I found that the tab, which is supposed to be highly visible to make things easier to find, was completely covered by the other pages.  Therefore they didn't do what I wanted them to do.  Not Day-Timers fault at all.No problem for the rating, the dividers are fine, just not really working for me.
This planner stand is pretty nice. I like the storage slots. One problem I do have is the bottom front of the holder (where the planner sits)is not connected. Every once in a while I find it has shifted and kind of falls into the storage tray. It is also hard to write in the planner when it is on the stand. But it holds the planner at a good angle for review of the pages and the two storage trays are nice to help keep clutter off the desk. It is kind of expensive but there is not much else out there unless you make one yourself. Overall I am satisfied with the stand.
Very nice pockets, but I liked the previous ones I bought better.  As they had pockets on both sides.  This set has pockets on only one side.
Many People are looking for a small space heater for there office.  You can save energy by turning back your main thermostat and using a small heater.  This device will warm your feet and much of the area right under your desk and it only uses 90- 120 watts.  Most small space heaters use 1000 watts minimum.  This device does cause a an odor of hot rubber.  It's pretty strong the first couple of days but it is quite a bit less after a week or so.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and there still is a little odor but not bad.
I have it under my desk in my office.  It works great.  A very good purchase.  i would certainly recommend it.
Works very well!I've worked in an office that is just below ground level for the past 13 year - the floor is concrete covered with carpet and the heat comes from vents in the ceiling, so the floor and cold desk chill you during the winter.I got the mat and put it under my desk and finally had warm feet for the first time in 12 winters.  It even works a bit as a radiant heater to warm the space beneath my desk making it tolerable to sit and focus on my work.The only downside is the first few days when it smells strongly of the rubber covering.  Made me feel like I worked in a Good Year factory.  A timer would be a good accessory so that you don't forget and leave it running at the end of the day.
I work from a home office in my basement (Just North of Milwaukee Wisconsin). It's an exposed basement so I have windows with a great view.  All good except the concrete floor, even with carpeting is very cold - always! I installed the heating pad under my desk and it keeps my feet warm and toasty. Problem solved - I recommend this heating pad as a great solution for anyone suffering with cold feet while sitting at their desk!
Writes really nicely. Every single pen other than space pens that I have used always stop writing almost immediately (except gel pens but those are too runny). There are always certain spots on almost any piece of paper that any other pens stop writing. The only bad thing I have to say about this pen is that it's really short. I should have realized when I was ordering it. It's usable, but it's an adjustment. My hands were used to pens a couple inches longer than this one.
I have a couple of examples of this model pen and enjoy carrying it very much.  Being very compact, it's very easy to carry in my front pants pocket along with spare change and keys, or to keep in the glove compartment of the car.  I've developed the habit of not leaving home without it, it's come in handy so many times to jot down a quick note.good things about this pen:  The ink always flows nicely, it has a smooth feel as it glides across paper--the consistency is somewhere between a gel pen and a standard ball-point.  It has a nice balance to it and a comfortable grip.  It really does write under running water, I've tried it!  A necessity if you work outdoors and have to take down notes.my complaints:  sometimes there's a little blob of ink on the tip of the pen if it hasn't been used in a few days which can be a little messy.  I've solved this by replacing the standard medium cartridge with a fine point.  The matte black pen has a chrome clip and barrel connector.  It looks very nice but I wanted a non-shiny pen.
This is my second Fisher. I like the class and quality of the pens, but I cannot open the X-750 should I need to refill it. Push, pull, twist, nothing works to open my X-750. It is a heavy pen, which sometimes is a distraction. But it is a Fisher, and that puts it ahead of the pack.  Tom Fergus
Brushed ivory colored printer paper. Only used on good quality inkjet, it is fine. Not sure how it looks on laser printer or lesser quality printer. Nice paper. Not that heavy. Solid seller.
great buy , just what the doctor ordered , i like the hard cover  , wide ruled  margin , would recommend
I finally broke down and got this product for screen printing negatives. I prnt two copies and overlap then and it work great for that.
I do cyanotypes and VanDyke Brown prints. I use this to make my digital negatives. Wonderful results over $ 60.00 a pack materials.  If you get  a bit of savings here, you can by more of other materials.
For what was once a standard in every classroom, the overhead projector is going the way of the typewriter and dial phone. I still utilize the overhead projector in my art room and finding transparency film at a good price is very difficult. This was a good deal for the product.
My daughter is starting her first teaching job and needed erasers for her entire class. These were just what we needed and the price was excellent! I have seen similar erases in the stores selling for $2 a piece. I recommend these highly.
They are not high quality, but will definitely last the year in my clasrooms. Great buy, I would do again!
This eraser met my expectations. I needed to order a dozen from somewhere and many sites wanted $4-5 for a single eraser...it's just an eraser!!!  This price was great and so far the eraser definitely serves the purpose and works just fine.
I teach 7th grade English and I tend to use the variety of colors that Expo offers for whiteboard markers.  The problem is that most of those markers are much more difficult to remove.  For the past three years I've just used the standard erasers and have always had problems.  They shed, they don't really erase, and sometimes they make the board a bigger mess.  Honestly, I'd kind of resigned myself to accept the idea that all whiteboard erasers were like this.I bought these out of convenience this year and have been pleasantly surprised.  They are much, much more effective than the standard Expo erasers.  Is it the best thing ever that changed my teaching career?  No.  But they are better.  Much better.
... as for the canned air aspect of this product, it's just that. A 10 oz. can of canned air, to shoot away dust and whatnot, with a little plastic straw nozzle attachment. And it works great.Note however, that this is a two-pack of 10 oz. cans. I've ordered this three times now, and it's always a two-pack. The model number for this item corresponds to a two-pack on Google as well.Plus, as it's a DOT restricted item, this will ship GROUND ONLY, whether or not you have Amazon Prime.
This is very good paper for creating booklets, books, signs, whatever you need larger stock for. Image quality is excellent on the HP and Epson printers we have used it with. Be sure to adjust your printer properties to account for the paper type, as this has a significant impact on image quality.My only wish is for a 20% heavier version of this stock. That would make it perfect for more of our book projects. Alas, this appears to be the heaviest stock in this HP line, so we use it and are very happy, but not perfectly happy. Four stars.
It does the job it is supposed to do i.e. 'protect materials against fading from exposure to sunlight, and from bending or creasing', but is is not as strong as I thought it would be. The  plastic used to manufacture the tube is far too thin. If you accidentally place something heavy on it, the tube (and anything inside of it) will be permanently deformed. This thing was definitely designed with lightness and portability in mind. If you need something that will survive being crushed by an average 180 lb. man sitting on it, use 2" PVC pipes with matching end caps!
Basic document tube that I plan to use for transporting posters for presentations. It's a bit difficult to extend and hold into place. Haven't quite figured out how to do that yet.
I really only needed 20 or so blades, but via Amazon there only seemed to be a choice between 5 blades, 100 blades, or 1000 blades. I guess I'll just have to have way more blades than I need. These #2 Xacto brand blades are much better than the Revell blades that are available locally. (I don't know why, but it seems that Micheal's and Hobby Lobby no longer stocks Xacto brand).
Note that these are the larger blades and will not fit the 'standard sized' #11 xacto handles. My own fault for ordering too quick and not paying attention. Blades are just as sharp as any other xacto blades!
We love these cookies and each of us has a favorite. Be it the sugar sprinkled cookies or my favorite, a soft cookie with nut pieces.They have decreased the number of cookies in the box from 2 layers of cookies (appr. 24) to one layer with appr 32 cookies total.Made in Denmark, these cookies do melt in your mouth. Stay with the original and skip the No Cholestrol or other variations.
Thank you notes, short missives. Everything is online these days. This is a product that shows you care. There is nothing like the feel of fine paper.
My daughter, 4.5 years, likes to write with it, but not to draw. It seems good for kids learning to write.
Great for travel but rather expensive when shipping is included.  Our Costco used to carry these and they were quite economical, but it no longer has them.  I am allergic to milk and airplanes and many hotels do not have alternatives to milk for adding to coffee.
I purchased the MVP2005U PA system four years ago to use at our junior team tennis events. Since then it has performed very well (plenty loud enough to reach 120 kids, plus parents etc). The microphone battery does drain when not in use, so make sure it is taken out after each event.Two years ago, the unit slid out the back of my SUV on my driveway, and while the case was damaged, the system still worked. On another occasion, a kid knocked it over, and yet again (the case falling apart by this stage), it still continued to function. Some glue later, it was still performing. However, two weeks ago the battery appeared dead after being charged for a number of days. Have't yet examined the battery, but it still works on its power a/c. Even if the battery is finally dead, the system has lived up to my expectations, and I would recommend it. The only design glitch I would mention, is that the PA is heavy, and the two small wheels are spaced too close together for any stability. Just be very careful when pulling it, or alternatively place it on a hand truck.
What can you say about a three-inch circle of plastic?It is sturdy, the sliding piece stays attached.  The top lip is a little thin, so your hole measurement needs to be pretty exact but that's nothing to complain about.If I needed another one, I'd buy the same one.
I like the collection of colors but the quality is not as good as most Wausau usually is. Nevertheless, it's nice paper and serves the purpose to add color to stationary without being overpowering.
I used a couple for behind the entertainment area in the family room.  I try to control all the mess.  They are great for large cables.  They are larger than I expected.
I like the portability of this file cart.  My husband and I share a small office space so whenever one of us needs to get into files, we are usually in the other's way.  With the Fold'nRoll, I can move the cart to wherever I want.  At the end of the year, I plan to put the lid on the bin, label it and put it in storage, replacing with another Rubbermaid bin for next year's files.
LIION BATTERY FOR A PANSCONIC CAMERA.  I HAVE USED THE CAMERA 3 TIMES SINCE ADDING THE NEW LIION BATTERY.  SO FAR IT HAS WORKED VERY WELL.  CHARGE IS HOLDING MUCH LONGER THEN ORIGNAL EQUIPMENT BATTERY.
That's all I gotta say.I used it.Worked perfect.It is not fancy but is worth the money.
It his putty is a bit tougher than other brands I've used. You have to knead it a lot before using to get it to be sticky. I also need more of it than I've used with other brands. When I hung papers with a small dot like I have in the past the paper fell off the wall within a few days. I added more putty and it's fine now. Only used to hang regular construction paper.
I've tried a couple of different products for hanging items in my classroom and this is the best so far.  It's malleable right out of the package, reusable, holds up well as long as you use enough of it, and comes off completely with a little rubbing-just roll some putty over the scraps left on the wall.  It does leave an oily mark on paper if you leave it on too long so I wouldn't suggest it for anything valuable, but it doesnt mark up the wall.
This product works just as advertised. If you'd like to avoid putting pin holes in you walls, or leaving tape residue it's great! I use it to put posters up on some of my walls (which slope in at ~ 45 degree angles) and it holds quite well. Definitely better quality than the white or yellow coloured putties. No complaints other than the comparatively high price of shipping (almost 3x the cost of 1 unit), which of course justifies buying in bulk :)
Works great!  No marks or paint stripped off of wall.  I've tried so many different types of poster tack and putties in my years of teaching and this is one of the best!
These poster putty are pretty sticker and good quality. They haven't come off yet but I think they are going to stay on. Like it!
The painted cement block walls that grace most public school classrooms are tough surfaces to attach interesting artifacts to...especially when the teacher is required to "leave no marks". Most teachers these days augment their schools' budgets out of their own pockets, and the annual purchase of Poster Putty by my wife, a master third grade teacher, is no exception. Over the years, she has purchased a gob of this stuff (pun intended)...typically at the start of the year. She has found that Duck Poster Putty stays pliable...and subsequently better holds artifacts...longer than competing products (notably 3M Scotch). She tells me she has enough to do without needing to re-hanging artifacts midway through a trimester. Enough said.
I purchased the Henkel Duck Adhesive Mounting Putty to help decorate my preschooler's room.  He is constantly bringing home new artwork from school, and I wanted something that I was comfortable letting him use himself to place his pictures where he wanted them.  This was the stuff - it works great for posters and light pictures.  I did have a problem with a heavier item, but I'm sure the product wasn't meant for that.  It is easy to use, easy to remove, and does not mark white walls.
My kids can decorate their own rooms without the damaging the walls.  I love it and so do the kids.
I used this product to hold three large laminated/erasable calendars to a wall. It holds the calendars really well which are rather heavy and big. I have used sticky tack or putty before for the same purpose and had issues with it peeling off paint. Fortunately, I was not charged for the damage. I chose this product as I knew it was a different brand from last time, but had the same problem. I was adjusting the location of the calendar and a big piece of paint came off with just the one piece of putty. The other brand had the problem with two or three pieces and it took off a layer of paint and this took off more than a layer, but just with one piece of putty instead of three. This could be because I like to make things secure and I pressed the putty too hard to the wall, but I had issues with the other brand allowing the calendars to fall off the wall. Also, maybe the type of paint and how recent the room was painted could have been a factor too.  So far I have not had any issues with the calendars falling off the wall and it has been several months. It probably works best on a surface other than a painted wall like contact paper or certain wall papers, but I do not have too many spots like that and I want the calendars in a spot where I see them often not in the pantry covering up shelves with contact paper on them. It does not really bother me it took off some paint as currently the calendar covers it up and it is barely noticeable with the calendar gone and the room will probably end up repainted anyway. The product does work and will securely hold an item like a big laminated calendar to a wall and allow you to erase and write on the calendar.
I've seen this on other websites in black and/or gray, but not offered here. I'm not crazy about the color, but it does the job. Unlike other cord winders, it actually STAYS put (doesn't unwind with the slightest movement) - at least more securely than the other ones I've purchased.I don't agree that it works for larger cords - it works well for normal appliance cords (ie hair dryer thickness not vacuum cord). I wish they made these so they were retractable, kind of like a measuring tape mechanism where you can set the length at a certain point...
This cable winder is quite larger than the other ones here on amazon; which was just what I needed. The smaller cord wraps just aren't sturdy enough or big enough for some of the longer/thicker cords. This one is good for high quality headphone cords or mouse cords and such; where the small ones won't do. My only complaint is that it can be a bit stiff, so when you pull on both ends of the cords to unwind it, it makes a rather annoying plastic grinding noise. But then again, this is good for storing a thick cord for a while.
I reluctantly bought this based on the reviews I read.  I wasnt sure how sturdy it would be.  I am happy to report it works great for me.  It is a bit flimsy, so thats why it only gets 4 stars.  I was able to run 2 cat6 cables, 2 hdmi, 1 coax, and a small power cord through it with no problem.  I wasnt sure how the HDMI would do since its a thicker cable, but it made a couple wraps around.
I was looking for a product that would do a better job of concealing my rats nest of wires created by my dual monitor set up in my office. It has concealed the bulk of the wires but it is a little flimsy and I had some difficulty snapping the cover on because the base got a little twisted with the weight of the wires. I would definitely recommend but depending on the amount of wires you want to hide you may have some troubles.
I have 2 PC's and 2 monitors as well as an external HD, router modem and a host of other items that need to be plugged in. The wife was tired of seeing Medusa behind the computer so I purchased this and was able to hide just about all of the wires inside the box and behind my desk.It's much neater now..
I reluctantly ordered the Wiremate after reading a series of mixed reviews - most of which were very poor. But since there isn't much else on the market - except the Cable Manager which I already own (works great, but all wires are exposed) and the Belkin Concealed Surge Protector (which I own and LOVE, but doesn't have much room for wires), I tried it.Am I happy with the Wiremate? YESSince there is basically nothing else out there, the Wiremate will have to do. And it does its job rather well.No wiree stick out when wrapped correctly.The cover snaps on easily, but remove the cover carefully to avoid snapping the thin plastic tabs (as other reviewers have done). The tabs could release much easier.Yes, the plastic is thin, but it is not flimsy. I have a modem, 2 routers, and a portable WD harddrive sitting on top (with the wires inside) and it looks great with no sag.The wiremate is big! Bigger than I expected. But the look is clean enough that it isn't an eyesore. Plus you can mount it out of sight if desired.So, all in all, I am very happy with the wiremate. I would give it 5 stars if the plastic tabs weren't so poorly designed. Until something better comes along, this will have to do.
I've been looking around for a simple cable management for a while now. I took a chance with this one and I'm glad I did. It was real simple to use. I was just using twisty ties on them but I needed to conceal it.I separated all the wires and worked with one wire at a time. Got all the slack out of the wires. Its nice that you can wrap them any way you can to pull the slack out. Once all the wires were in there. I simply put zip ties to to hold them all together. Finished it looks really good.I'm a Gamer and a pc enthusiast so I have a lot of stuff on my desk with a whole lot of wires. This works perfectly.The quality is alright. The plastic feels light and flimsy. No big worry since my desk sits against a wall and nothing is going to hit it in fear of cracking the cover. The tabs you wrap the wires on could be stiffer with tabs sticking out a little further to hold wires on so they don't slide off. Other then that I'm happy with it. Its cheap and simple.
Product is cheaply made, but works and is simple. I would recommend this product.  Be delicate with the cable management and it won't break.  Once in place, secure in a location that is kick free or heavy impact free.
I like this because it helped me integrate a ton of cables quickly.  I was able to stuff in all my PC cables.  The only challenge is getting the cover to stay on.  It won't click shut if you've over stuffed it.  This is not a bad solution if you can hide its rather large form factor behind something.  I'm still searching for a better solution for situations where you can't hide it.
It is simply a plastic box with some posts to wind your cables around to keep them organized. It seems a little "plasti-crappy" and light. But it held a huge volume of cables for me and the lid has come on and off a half a dozen times without breaking the tabs. Like a lot of folks, I have a cat that delights in chewing through wires. Phone and iPad chargers, speaker cables, headphones, network cables, and even power cables have fallen victim to this little muncher. So, I bundled up all of my desktop wires into this box and pushed the desk against the wall enough so he couldn't get behind it, and my problem has been solved. I could see where it would look nice when used in an area where the wires would otherwise be visible, like an office environment. Now that mess of "spaghetti" is neatly tucked away, making your desk more professional looking.
I like how my home office appears so much more neat and organized now that this product is in place.  It's not a complete solution but beats not using anything at all.
I was looking to get an electric toothbrush after many miserable visits to the dentist.  I was debating between the Oral B and Sonicare and chose the Oral B for the following reasons.1. Oral B brushhead is shaped circular, so it surrounds your teeth better.  It's circular motion combined with the small head gives you access to the crevices better than the full brushhead of the Sonicare.  This is the main reason why I chose Oral B over Sonicare.  The Sonicare doesn't oscillate, it's more like vibrate.  Sonicare is considerably quieter than Oral B, though.2. Oral B is a bit cheaper than Sonicare.3. Cleaning the gook off the toothbrush is easier for Oral B than Sonicare, trust me on this one.4. Brushhead cost is cheaper for Oral B than Sonicare.There are a few things I didn't like about this toothbrush, which are minor.  It is noisy.  When you are brushing, the person sitting next to you can't hear the TV.  The charging base emits really bright light which blinks.  It's annoying, minorly.  Oh, because the brushhead is so small, you'll need a separate toothbrush or tongue scraper for tongue cleaning.  I've read other reviewers say that the extra attachments like tongue scraper for Oral B are useless so don't bother spending money on those.  Get the regular ones...i.e. tongue scraper, floss, etc.If you must have top of the line everything, you can get the Oral B Triumph, but do you really need to pay an extra $20-$40 for a smiley face on an LCD?  I didn't think so.  I bought 7800 DLX which came with 1 charging base with 2 units (perfect for families) and paid about $80(in NYC).  Triumph was ($100) at the same place but that was with 1 unit.
One thing The package arrived super fast, I was expecting it for February 25/ March 12th  and arrived like one week before, I'm really happy about that. The Pen nibs are really comfortable and they do the work pretty well. 4 of 5 only because the Finger Pen nib is a little strange.
I tested them one nib at a time, and found some of  rather difficult to write on paper.But the others are really terrific to go on until the ink ebbs out - whee!
this was a gift for my niece and newphew and they liked it very much. the color is so vibrant and last a little longer that a regular highlighter
Works much better than another brand that I have. Adjustment is much less picky, on when I want on, off when I want off. I have it on a Media Center PC, turn off the computer, everything goes off. Shipping was fast, and the price was good.
It is a very good scale. it is light to carry and not that big in size.  the only bad thing about it is the weight limit of 220 lbs.  other than that it is serving my needs.
This scale has a nice size for larger boxes, it's light weight,  and I like how it has a cord leading to the control unit so you can easily read the weight to the side of the box being weighed, rather than having to get down on the floor to look at the scale under the box like with some scales.  It seems to be accurate for different weights for shipping. You can also change it back and forth from kg to pounds.  It seems to prefer the kg setting, reverting back to it from time to time like a default setting, and I like the way it reads better than the pounds setting, so I just use a conversion screen that I found on google and it's really easy to get an exact weight conversion that way. The setting for pounds works well and is accurate too. I recommend this scale.
The scale arrived in excellent condition, looked as represented, but I am disappointed to find that amounts less than eight ounces don't even register.  This means I'm going to have to purchase an additional scale for those small amounts.  If I'd had time, I probably would have returned this scale and searched for a different one that would solve that problem.
I like the scale.  The default is to kilos, which I found out when my UPS shipping charges were coming in under weight by over a half.  When setting the scale to measure in pounds, it comes up as Pounds and Ounces as opposed to tenths of a pound.
I use these to weigh smaller packages, 50-lbs and under, and am very satisfied. I have used larger and more expensive brands/models in the past with varying results, and for the money, you really can't go wrong with the Escali brand in general. These are accurate, durable, and about as straightforward as you can get. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
The overall of the product is OK, but I have to be constantly fixing the cover to fit the IPOD video 80GB.
Trick to get screen protector on easily no bubbles no lint: soak it in rubbing alcohol first, then apply it. It will slide around till it is perfect, then let it sit for 15 minutes to dry and it will stick tight.Screen protector is transparent enough and strong, and reduced the visibility of a lot of hairline scratches in my screen. But it doesn't reduce glare, for that try Zagg which works great.Case works well, protects device, controls work. I would prefer a sexier color.. white, black, etc., but is ok and looks unique. The touch controls seem a little bit less responsive but they work.Zcover makes great silicone skins but more expensive and this model is discontinued.
Pros: 1) Simple and inexpensive, but provides solid scratch protection; 2) Good armband and lanyard.  Cons: 1) Plastic screen cover is good, but not beautiful (you have to try to get all the bubbles out, and that's just about impossible); 2) Not much padding.
I bought this as a for my boyfriend as a buisness card holder however he is actually using it as a wallet instead and is quite happy with it.
Sleek design.  Could be a little more compact, but overall works great.I primarily use it to protect my business cards.  It keeps them neat and clean.Recommend this to anyone looking for a simple, inexpensive card holder.
I've had this wallet for a few years now and I love it.  It's held up very well and when considering the price of it compared to other wallets it would still be a bargain at 5x the price.Why only 4 stars then?  Because I wish the end caps were machined aluminum as well.
I've never been organized enough for putting credit cards and such back in wallets.  For the last 10 years or so, they've just ended up in random purse pockets, jacket pockets, and pants pockets, which often led to moments of panic when I couldn't find one.  I also went through 3 of my favorite Visa last year because it kept getting bent and cracked from being in my pants pockets all the time.I love love love this case.  I know people have complained that it doesn't hold much, but really, in this economy, how much should you be carrying?  I have my driver's license, my ATM card, the one credit card I always use, my insurance cards, and a few punch cards for the pet store.  I carry it with me whenever I just have to run a short errand, when I'm running over to Dunkin' Donuts from my office, or every chance I can get to ditch my purse. ;)  Plus, none of the cards get bent or cracked and none of the corners peel.I'm going to buy a second one in another color to store receipts in my tote back so they don't get all wadded up and unreadable when I balance my checking each month.
Bigger than I anticipated (wider and taller than an American drivers license), but sturdy product. The elastic seems that it will last, and the metal enclosure is sleek, much better looking than the plastic one.  Recommended.
This product is just what I need when I carry the basic essentials.  Several people have asked where I got it.
I use this instead of a wallet but I don't carry money in it, just my credit cards, driver's license, etc.  It holds 7 cards without jamming.  I do have to carry it in my front pocket as it's very uncomfortable in my back pocket.  I also keep a business card between the first card (my license) and the case.  Otherwise the license face gets scratched up.I've always looked for the thinnest way to carry my cards.  This is it.
This item was given as a Dude gift including personalized fake ID cards like "McLovin" Hawaii Drivers license and buddy pics with Obama. Sturdy Metal Pocket Safe
Had this product for a few years now and it still works! It really helps protect your business cards while adding a bit of geeky enjoyment. :)
Could have been a little wider to make it easier to also keep currency in. However, if you are just using it for credit cards or ID it is perfect.
I might have given another star if there were just a millimeter more of clearance in the slots for credit cards and my driver's license.  I had to shave the edges of my credit cards to get them into them, and it's a real challenge to get my license out.  And don't take the photo showing a beveled edge of these slots at face value--the bevels aren't there, at least in the one sent to me. It appears this skimping was to accommodate the provided plastic insert for additional credit cards, which I don't need and immediately discarded.  I also would have preferred bi-level currency pockets like those in my worn out but discontinued Rolfs (which was actually smaller in overall dimensions).Otherwise, I like it fine; materials and construction appear to be first class.
The 3M product is excellent!  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM SHOPLET.COM THROUGH AMAZON.  THEY DO NOT SUPPORT SHIPPING ERRORS.  I have tried to get credit for a missed product but to no avail.  I will not shop Amazon or Shoplet again.
The product was great.  I have only two complaints.  One is that the written description did not make it clear that the paper was matte.  I saw it in small writing in the top corner of the illustration, and I just hoped the illustration was indicative of what I would get (and wasn't just one example of different offertings, such as glossy).  It was, but it could have been more clear.  My other complaint was that shipping cost me about three times the cost of the actual product. Furthermore, I orderd two packs, and the shipping just about doubled!
It can be almost impossible to turn at times.  Instead of moving one to the right, you have to go three to the left, or fiddle with it so it lines up properly.  You can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move the way you want it to.I was hoping it'd be better cause it's really cool that it fits in your pocket.  It's just too hard to turn.  I ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way.  And I cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing.  I really like this product (I'm buying another one), I just wish it wasn't so stiff.Maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it, you can finish a rubik's cube in 5 minutes, max, so I don't see the need to prevent it from turning.  Apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter.
Have to line the rows up well to turn but it was always like that on any of them back in the 80's too - just how they are made but no problem doing it.  Love this and it's retro fun-ness! :-)
I got this cube just as a keychain and it is pretty good. It moves ok and corner cuts ok but for the price it is fairly decent. Get this cube if you have some cube lube such as lubix.
Very convenient size.  I wish they would design a clip that let you take the cube off the key ring even if it left part of the ring attached.  It's hard working a small cube and the chain really gets in the way.  Also the "action" on the cube is frustrating.  I'm sure this is due to the size.  It's really probably designed more for "show", but in a pinch if you're hooked on "cubing" and are stuck somewhere with time on your hands it does work!
I bought this to fiddle around with at work when I need a distraction from the grind.  I am a decent cuber and can solve the full size cube consistantly between two and three minutes.  This one takes me longer because of it size and stiffness.  I have no use for it as a keychain so I removed the chain from mine.  It does easily and inconspicuously fit in a pocket.
i removed the chain and installed a &#34;split ring&#34; the size of the ones that come on a swiss army knife. then i made a loop with some cord and proudly hang the cube from my rearview mirror!  try it, but don't cube while driving!!!
This is a review of the Rubik's Cube mini 3x3x3 puzzle cube on the keychain.  I personally was looking for a cube small enough to fit in my coat pocket.  When I'm out and about, the original size cube gets in the way, especially in my work bag.  I never bought this cube for what it was intended for...a keychain.  I was not looking for a keychain at all.  You will find that a lot of reviewers are disappointed because they want the size and portability of the small cube, but they are not interested in the keychain aspect of it.I don't know about you, but I've never had a keychain last a long time, unless it's metal.  All of the plastic ones break over time.  The presume the same would apply to this item.  I opened this item, scrambled the cube and solved it.  The cube is very, very tight, and difficult to maneuver, but it really works.  If you are too rough with it, I believe it would break in no time.  I took a wire cutter and cut the cube off the keychain, and it is much easier to maneuver that way.  If you are buying this item because you are fond of the Rubik's Cube, and you want a keychain to show your fondness...cool, you will love it.  But, if you are looking for a quality mini cube, that you will use frequently...this is not the one for you.The problems I had with the original size cube were that it was in my work bag, getting kind of beat up, unprotected, and the stickers were getting damaged.  I think I'll stick to the larger cube when on the go, but I found a hard plastic protector box for the cube on an auction site, which will eliminate the cube getting beat up in my bag.  Some of you should try that too.  Also, the auction sites sell miniature 3x3x3 cubes that are of better quality and a bit bigger than this item.  They are small but not keychains.  I think the keychain is cute, but use it as just that...a keychain.  I would rate this a 5 as a keychain, but a 3 for the fun aspect of it.  I chose something in between because I have to be fair, this is primarily meant to be a keychain, and secondary as a toy, because it actually functions. Even if you bought this and cut the keychain off the cube, you still got your money's worth in my eyes.  Just don't take this thing too seriously.  I hope that helps.
This is a cool little toy. Many of my friends are amazed that it actually works.It's unfortunately a bit too big to be a useful key chain, it does not fit in my pocket very well. Sometimes it can stick, more so than the full sized cube. But if you're looking for a small cube to practice on this works just fine.
We use this chart as a chore chart with rewards.  It is exactly what we needed and we are very pleased with our purchase.
I bought this chart with the intention of just having a pocket chart for student lunch cards, student hall passes, and attendance cards. I thought the pockets would hold 3" x 5" index cards since that is what we use at our school for the lunch cards. However the chart only fits the small cards given.. which are probably only 2" x 3". The chart is fine for the cards it has, but would've been better if it could hold a card that is a more standard size.
I believe this would be very useful to parents or teachers. I am personally not the one using it though. It was a gift to my daughter to help her children with chores and everyday tasks.
My own fault, but I was quite surprised to open the package and discover it was much smaller than I expected.  Next time, I'll look at the measurements more closely.It works just fine for what I had planned, though.  I like that it comes with cards, also.No problems with the company or anything.  Overall, it was a good experience!
Of all the fans I have used this if by far the most versitle.  It has a slight hum but no gears to strip. The flexible blades can be packed and bent but return to form when run. It can be stopped and start up again. I have used the fan for six months and just keeps on hummin.
Envelopes are not as good as the cards...If you have time after delivery for doing this, they worth it.I didn't, and half of them are still in my night table.
This letterhead is great!  I use it to make end-of-the-year awards for my elementary chorus members.  The shipping is a bit high, but as I could no longer find it at Office Max (where I used to purchase it) I had to suck it up.Masterpiece Sheet Music Letterhead - 8.5 x 11 - 100 Sheets
These are pretty cute and work well. My only complaint is that the magnets that come with them are very thin and are hard to pick up off the plate.
this journal is of great quality...but it is more of a small to medium size than large if you ask me.
These ties work quite well but I don't expect them to last as long as some others I have used but are still a great value.
Ordered this to wrangle my cord mess. They work great! I would definitely buy again. The velcro works rather well, seems of good strength and are more than big enough for my 5-6 cords I'm securing. The package held more than enough ties too. My one complaint is that I wish it secured in a bit of a different way, but it completely fine for hold cables in place.
Who doesn't like velcro?  I use it to wrap computer cables and it great.  I gave my kid some to make projects out of too!
These work, but they are very thin compared to the raw rolls of velcro strips.Other than the thickness, They seem to function fine and are of decent length for bundling most cables.
It works and, at the time I purchased it, was quite economical. Tends to stick to itself while you are working it around the cables but no big deal.
Not the toughest Velcro strips out there, but for light use they're perfect at that price.  Probably best if you're going to leave cords strapped in.
I just bought hundreds of these to clean up my massive cable wall. (I work in television). They are very cost-effective and do the job admirably. Not the absolute fanciest of this type of product I've ever seen, but that's a good thing. They're slim, clean and work fine.
Comes with 2 rolls of velcro ties:  1 roll of 25 black/black velcro ties and 1 roll of 25 charcoal/gray velcro ties.  Does the job of organizing cables.  Main intent is for wire-management use of various computer and home theater cables.
so only thing is that at each end of both roles you done have a full tie they are cut off almost in half, but i still found a use for them
very useful product.. though.. forwarning the grey completely stands out when used on black cables.
I was looking for something to use to keep my cables in some sort of orderly fashion.  I've used them to tame the mess of wires behind my computer desk, the wires between the television, video games and receiver and on the cables on my podcasting rig.  These do the job, but are a bit lighter weight than I'd like.  It can also be a pain to route the one end of the strap through the slit on the other side.  The bottom line though is that they work and they are priced well.  If you need to keep wires from getting tangled these will do the job.
The velcro portion is small compared to other velcro I've used in the past (hence the 4 stars), but I've used over half of them on many different cables to tie them up when coiled and they work great.  I don't know how long they will last, but so far I really enjoy them.
I specifically purchased these for keeping my tool cords organized. They work perfectly for this purpose and stay attached to the tool cord when the tool is being used.
You get lots of ties on this roll. They are very versatile. After 6 months, they are holding up very well.
Good for light duty strapping. Thin, flexible, adjustable, water proof and strong enough to hold 5-10 lbs. has many uses.
I had a million cords in my backpack for work.  This does a great job of securing them.  For most of my cords the ties are way to long.  But they can be cut and used in pieces.  These are much better then zip ties as they are reusable.Downside to these is they stick to anything of cloth. or other wraps that are in your bag.
This product works as you would expect it to and is a great value. Many of the ties are longer than I need so I cut them in half with scissors to make even more ties as I actually don't need the loop at the end of the tie.
These don't fall apart but there are better solutions if you are tying and untying cables together. These are great for bunching a group of cables that run together.
Not the highest wuality, but for the price it worked just fine.  I will see how durable they are over time, not real confident.
great for keeping electrical cords tidy for science lab equipment. Easy to install on cord and they don't fall off.
I like this product, and it's a great price for the product.  I like the 2 color options it gives you, and I like the length, which is easy to cut to smaller pieces.
Well they work for smaller things.  I know it is velcro but it doesn't seem to have the griping power of some other velcro the same size.  The design seems to be that the insert slot doesn't do anything but align the stuff because ti loop back you need to twist the strap.  It would work better if the design allowed sticksion on both sides so you have the option to loop back.
These work just fine for me, and are quite convenient to not have to deal with twisting wire-ties.  These are nothing too special; they're what they are...velcro strips...and they work just fine for me.  If I had to say something I didn't like, or something I would have liked better if it were available, would simply be that I would have liked to get all black instead of half black and half grey; that's a personal preference, that's all, and of course not everyone has to (nor should) share that opinion.
Just recived and used several for the project I needed, did exactly what I needed them to do. I thought the velcro might be a little heavier material.
They work OK. I was hoping for a heavier strip like the ones that came with the power source on my laptop, but these should be OK for all the other cords I have to carry, e.g. electrical extension cords, VGA cables, USB extension cords, etc.
I bought these ties to hold my computer against the back wall of my desk and they work well enough, but there's another product somewhere on amazon that gives you twice as much for a similar price. I didn't buy that because it lost its super saver shipping when i tried to buy it.That said, this product serves its purpose and won't give out to a decent amount of force (pulling apart parallel to the adhesive).
I have  a bunch of electric  cords, some long (up to 50 feet) and others short (like 8 feet).  When not in use, they are a pain as they tend to tangle even when you have carefully coiled them.  These ties hold the cords (or any type rope or other material) in one position so you don't have problems uncoiling the cord later.  They are reusable, and they are relatively inexpensive.  You get a bunch, and my only problem is sometimes I would like one slighly longer.  It's too bad you can't just buy a roll of these things and cut accordingly (they can be cut with a good sharp pair of scissors).  They work for me.
Whether the ties are used to bind wrapped cords or adapt items around the house, the ties hold well and can be reused easily.
I have enough of these for the majority of the rest of my life now and I am definitely the OCD type when it comes to organization.  I tie up, glue down or velcro anything that moves.  I'm pleased with these although I'm not big on the light grey ones; all black would have worked better for me but that's a minor ordeal.  I'm rating this product as a 4 because they are a little thinner than what I expected them to be.  So far, all of them are holding up fine; just expected them to be a little sturdier looking.  They do grip well and I've had no problems with any of them coming loose after I've used them to wrap something up.
I use these velcro ties for so many different projects and they work awesomely. They are just as described in the description. I would recommend.
These are great for walk-behind mowers that have the "dead-man" throttle.  To keep it running, wrap a tie around the throttle-handle. The mower keeps on running when you need to step away for a moment.
This product is very useful, but since it will stick to anything (fabric) that it can. Therefore no useful on cords that will touch clothes (e.g., extra long headphones cords, etc.) For that reason I take away one star. Otherwise a great product.
Have been looking for these velcro ties for some time.  These are really great for tidying up all the cables and wires
Having a husband who is a techie I need reusable velcro straps. These solve the problem, but being a person who likes color it would be nice to have something other than black or gray to choose from. Being able to sort by color when you have multiple cords you are dealing with would be the best of both worlds.
Good value for light to medium duty velcro straps.  They can be written on with sharpie type pens to identify items, such as microphone cable owner ID, length, etc.
At first I was a bit disappointed by the [lack of] heft of these ties, as they are thinner than traditional Velcro wire wraps. These svelte ties can be cumbersome to use much like extremely thin tape can be difficult to handle, often sticking to each other in a tangled mass. Where the user can accept such limitations, these ties offer great value for many applications.The pliability becomes an asset in applications where hairpin loops are needed. One good example is bundling a laptop security cable. This type of Velcro tie does an excellent job of capturing one side of the somewhat rigid steel cable bundle and pulling it towards the other side.  This effectively compresses the round bundle into a more manageable oblong one.The lack of color is another issue. In some situations, it provides a cleaner look whereas in others in hampers visibility. Overall, these ties are complementary to other cable management tools. Given the price is so reasonable, it makes sense for both the professional and hobbyist to have these around just in case they are needed.
This holds stuff together. My cables are no longer flapping around under my desk. Great value for the money. This velcro stuff is gonna be big, I just know it.
I have many electronic devices connected to my computer, so my "collection" of wires was amazing. With this product I was able to order the cables very well, so that none remain on the ground. Its only fault is that they come in a standard size, so you sometimes have a big piece of the trip hanging (you could cut it, but I dont think its a good idea). Overall, good product.. But maybe you could find a better one though.Tengo muchos aparatos electr&oacute;nicos conectados a mi computadora, por lo que mi "colecci&oacute;n" de cables era sorprendente.  Con este producto pude ordenar muy bien los cables, de tal modo que ninguno quedara por el suelo. S&uacute; &uacute;nico defecto es que vienen en un tama&ntilde;o est&aacute;ndar, por lo que a veces puede sobrar gran parte de la tira (podr&iacute;as cortarla, sin embargo el sobrante pues probablemente terminar&iacute;as bot&aacute;ndolo).
These velcro cable ties work very well and the pack comes with many more than you probably need. The only problem I had was with the durability. The material is very thin, and if you use these in a location where you will be repeatedly adjusting, moving, or re-using them, they will rip fairly easily. If they are for semi permanent application you should have no problems.
Got these on a whim. It was a great deal and needed some cable organization in my life. It was a great buy. They aren't long enough were you find yourself re wrapping them around the cable due to excess and not too short where you need to double up. However, I did find myself needing to use two ties for a cable and thanks to the little loop hole you can double these up no problem.
Zip ties work, but these are easily removable. They are durable, and easy to use. They attract lint like white on rice.
I  like these -  using the cardboard roller that came with paper towels - even paint them to match the wall - will continue but strap them now
These are ok but not as strong connection as i expected. I wish they also had a bigger size for these. They are too small for thick wires.
The cable ties that I have used in the past are much thicker and look like they would hold up better.  Initially these look very thin and like they would break easily and not hold tight.  But, the velcro seems to hold well and pulling on one of them they seem to be stronger than they look.
It's January, which means corporate holiday parties all up and down the calendar -- though I'm not sure celebrating three weeks after New Years' really counts as having 'holiday spirit'. Unless the true meaning of Christmas is getting the deepest discount possible on that Doubletree Inn ballroom where Joan from accounting is going to grope the mail room guy during during the "Salesperson of the Year" announcement. Did I miss a Charlie Brown special covering that? Probably.Anyway, I had to attend one of these company 'holiday' parties -- and they said it was be a swanky black tie affair. So I figured it was time to upgrade my formal wardrobe.I figured the first thing I needed for a black tie party was a black tie. But why buy just one, when I could get a whole fifty ties for under four bucks? Who said looking like a million bucks has to be expensive?Best of all, these ties come with velcro and are "self-gripping". So I didn't even have to learn how to tie them. I just mashed a few together, looped them around my neck, and voila! I was the prettiest primping penguin at the party.Or at least the cheapest. And I had enough ties left over to fashion a tasteful cummerbund and tails. If I get another set before the party next year, I'll make myself a nice vest, and maybe some spats. Eventually, I'll go in a complete outfit made only of ties. Eat your heart out, Mr. Blackwell!
Strap took a little strength to snap on but hopefully this makes it harder to come off.  It is  a good replacement for the straps that usually come with bags. It is thicker than the usual cushion and so is  more comfortable.
Great product! Great service! It arrived right when it was supposed to. Easy shipping and no problems at all. The teacher cart is perfect for bringing all of your stuff home from school. We got this cart for my daughter's teacher. I have the same cart, but a deluxe version of it that has cup holders and a bungee cord for carrying all of the stuff. I didn't know there were two different version of the cart, so I was a bit discouraged that it wasn't exactly like mine, but it is still nice and does the job. It folds flat for easy storage at school or in your car when you are not using it.
I actually love this - except when I have to move it. It does roll, but it could use larger wheels. Nevertheless, I would buy it again.
As a teacher, I think that this is an excellent product particularly when accompanied by the &#34;Store more Apron&#34;. It allow a range of varying sized and shaped objects and/or several books and folders to be carried without fear of spills.The one problem that I have, and I had been warned by others who own this product, the handle does not extend easily and often will jam causing much pulling and pushing to get it to move. The first one that I purchased worked but the next one was inoperable. My advice to any purchasers, check the handle extension out thoroughly because if it is sticking when you get it, it will only get worse with time.
I use this to carry my stuff everywhere! It works great and has not given me any problems (For resource teachers, it's quite a boon for all that stuff you have to carry around!) The aluminum handle does seem a little flimsy though, but it has held so far. I would get this product again.
Great product. Pity could not find any in the Australian website. My son enjoys putting the sequence together and it encourages him to speak in sentences . He describes each picture , as he puts the pictures in the right sequence.
Order received in a timely fashion.  Product provides an effective means of rendering a CD unreadable for a very reasonable price.
but because the chamber is full, I haven't needed to use it yet. It turns on, the cover opens, I haven't had to clean it yet and it has no discernible scent so I guess I'm content.
I bought this to weigh dye for fabric dyeing.  I've only used it a few times but, judging from the colors I'm getting, it appears to be accurate.  It's also easy to use.  I calibrated it initially with 2 100-gram weights and have then used it without recalibration.  I can't vouch for its longevity since I've only had it for a short time, but so far, so good.
This scale works pretty well. The pad is a bit small and the hinged cover that can be removed to weigh slightly larger items is difficult to remove. Bu, overall, the scale works, although I have found that it does fluctuate a bit more than I would expect. But, it is a good deal for the price.
I love tea and prefer to use loose teas.  However, determining how much tea to use per cup can be challenging since some teas are very fine and some are very course.  Using a tea scale (or jeweler's scale) is very helpful since tea is measured at 2.5 grams per 6 oz. cup.  This of course can be adjusted to taste, but at least you have a starting place.The Triton is very handy, inexpensive and could also be used for measuring gold so you could check to see if you're being ripped off. I'm very happy with this purchase.
This is my third scale of this sort, and this one is the most difficult to use.  It is almost too touchy to feel accurate.
This was purchased for an at home Chemistry class. The scale was great and I would recommend to a friend.
Great little scale, especially for the price. (under $20).Good accuracy - I have a set of gram weights from 50 down to 1 gr that I tested on the scale and all measured within their respective weight specs.Also quite sensitive - Don't blow on it while measuring!I purchased it to weigh golf clubs and club components so really liked the 0.1 gr plus/minus spec.Only complaint is that the digital display is a bit dim and hard to read at some angles.
I just bought this bag, and while it is a bit pricey for a graduate student, I just fell in love with the design of it! It has zippers for the two outside pockets so that you can fit even more in it -- great for legal pads, folders, books, etc. The only complaint I have is a stylistic one: I bought the bag in chocolate brown, and I hate the fact that they used PINK contrast stitching and fabric on the inside. This is just a personal quirk because I HATE pink! -- thus the four stars instead of five even though I love everything else about the bag.
These little hooks came in very handy in my living space, which has all metal walls.  I'm in the military and we live in containers.  The hooks were good in that the magnets were large and held whatever I hung on them.  However, the hooks were pretty small so only held small or lightweight items.
This cable does a great job of taking my hdtv signal and putting it on an 8 foot wall. Football is absolutely unbelievable. I wish it were a little longer in case I decide to mount my projector on the ceiling, but I can always get a vga extender.
I love this little book! I'm one who makes lists for everything and this book is absolutly every thing I look for in a notebook. It's ruled all the way to the to of the page, has a handy elastic closure and a sturdy pocket in the back! I'm getting all the colors next!
I love the desk, very sturdy and stylish.  Quality product worth every penny.  The reason i didn't give it a 5 was due to what the box looked like when it got here.  It looked like it went through a tornado to get here, i thought for sure the glass top was in a million pieces.  But it was okay...the only damage was a slight scratch in the back, you cant see it, and one of the plastic endcaps on the frame was broke out and scratched a little.  I glued it back in, no biggy.I was afraid my Tower wouldn't fit before I bought it.  I have a Thermaltake Armor A90 gaming case.  It fit in the tower holder perfectly...I had a few inches to spare horizontally and vertically.  The open design of the desk allows for plenty of air flow to my PC.
The color is kind of dull.  I'm going to use it.  It works in my printer.  But, I don't think I'd buy it again.
Purchased to give a little life to advertising for a 14-16 year old scout event.  Seems to have worked well.
the paper was great, the color was accurate to the photo, it arrived on time, and was a lot less expensive than it would've been at an office supply store.
It's about what I expected for the price - I do question the 20lb though - it is thinner than my other 20 lb paper
The product is great for what it is. Yes, the wrapping may be a little damaged but the paper inside is fine.
the product is great, but I wasn't paying enough attention, so I paid too much for shipping. Otherwise, very happy with the paper.
This attractive, light-to-middle-weight stationery features colors in the beige range. As the product name suggests, light map-and-globe graphics create a watermark-like effect at a very good price.It's not fine stationery but makes a nice statement for most purposes. Colors are acceptably within what I consider to be a masculine range, which--being a member of the masculine race myself--is a feature I look for in note cards and other stationery.Because this product does not come with envelopes, you'll need to buy beige no. 9 envelopes.
Bought it from Amazon and came in a couple of days.  I use it to help flowchart companies.  I have used Picket templates for 41 years.  There were 8088 computers and no hard drives.
The value was good but I thought the picture looks like for a regular utility knife, which is what I needed, so be careful, these are the snap off long blades
This kit was fun to use with my nephew.  It's more for the botany fan than for the Harry Potter fan, though!  It's only loosely related to Harry Potter in the labeling and instructions.  It also requires extra materials that aren't included in the kit.  They're not expensive, but if you want to open it and use it right away, you'll be delayed.  Drawbacks aside, the seeds were fresh and sprouted with little work, which is pretty key for a "grow some plants" kit.  It also opens up some other experiment options if you've got some imagination -- buy some seeds at the store and try out some more hydroponics, or buy some more nylons and herbs or different types of grass seed, and sprout some more mandrake heads!  Value is not in the materials purchased, which are meager, but in the learning that stems from the experiments.
Overall I am really satisfied with this product,  I don't feel I have to buy a different model at a much expensive price. I think this one does a great job as well as the expensive ones.And Shoplet (the company that sold me this product) is great to work with.
this is just what I needed for a quick, last minute project. I only wish it was less expensive.
Works well.. doesnt create snags as some punches do. Emptying the punch tray is a little bit of a pain but nothing to keep one from purchasing it.
looked everywhere for easy to use hole puncher for badges, found this and it works great. only downside is the rubber sizer slips, would be better if it locked in place.
This product works pretty well for our purposes in punching about 60-100 nametags per year.  My one complaint is that the adjustable paper gauge does not hold in place very well.
I received one of these several years ago from a friend of mine. After getting used to it, I was able to much more efficiently and comfortably frag all of my friends in Unreal Tournament and even won a tournament of Unreal Tournament 2004.I really grew to love this trackball. However, these trackballs get gunked up very easily, making the trackball slip on the rollers instead of turning them. Also, I managed to lose one of the very tiny balls the trackball rests on, making the mouse useless. I bought a replacement, and that one was very good, though had the same gunk issue. It also broke less than two years later, despite the fact that I was taking very, very good care of it.Tempted though I was to replace it with another Turboball, I decided to move onto another one of Kensington's trackball mice. The Turboball was very good, but an optical trackball is more convenient because it doesn't have rollers to constantly clean. I'm hoping my new one is a bit more durable than the Turboball as well.In closing, this is a fantastic trackball, but it does get dirty and isn't as durable as one might prefer.
I purchase this item for my granddaughter to teach her how to write.  She love using it. I would recommend this product to any one who wants to teach their children how to write.
This is exactly what it says, Industry standard comic paper, the only problem that i have with it is that unless you have REALLY tight pencils and don't need to erase anything too much that you WILL smear your inks cleaning up your pencils, this paper is also not good for steel nibs (they will tear into the soft paper) or large amounts of black that are put down via brush (it tends to warp no matter how stingy you are with the ink itself)  if you get this paper I would also reconsider getting a good supply of micron brush pens or just some decent felt tip pens for inking. I have used this paper over and over again however and am consistently happy with it despite its flaws. If you are looking for professional grade paper and want your art to be at industry standard for commissions this is probably the best way to go for any price that is not ridiculous.
I have used a Tracfone for three years now and they work very well. Often in places other phones don't have service; Tracfone does.  I am now on my third phone and I only experienced a little bit of a problem getting my minutes switched over this last time. However, after waiting almost three days for them to do it; I got online and did it myself. If you can follow directions online, you can usually solve any problems there.  I love my Tracfone.

not much to say they could lower price per minute but thats not the sellers fault
Bought a cellular and credits for a short stay in the USA. It worked as expected, I had no problems with it.
This is nice for certificates but I wish I had bought it locally as this was more pricey.  If you can't find it locally this works great.  Thin sheets so it works well in the printer.
These are the thinnest envelopes of this kind I've ever purchased, but as far as protection goes, no thicker paper is going to protect your disk any better.  If these cost less per unit, go for 'em.
Not the easiest things to put together, but I think that is a standard design problem for this style of frame.  They are sturdy, and hold a lot of weight.
Product does the job by assembling into a sturdy structure. The metal is dirty, so you'll have to wash your hands of fine metal shavings after putting this together. Also, the metal is poor quality so be careful to not cut yourself on the sharp edges. You'll simply need one average size flat head screwdriver to assemble.
I bought an old filing cabinet from work and it came without any hanging folder rails. These folder frames are like the dinky snap-together plastic ones you get at Office Max. They're stable, sturdy and easy to put together. You do need a couple of sets of pliers to break off the ends of the rails for your particular length, but its not anything beyond what the instructions call for. I was very happy with the purchase.
Not too difficult to put together and they do the job. Not great quality however for them being a low priced product I didn't expect it to be top notch.
fun, much much smaller than I expected, but I guess I should have read the size description for this item and I wouldn't have been so surprised when I finally held it in my hand. Overall it's good but don't give it to anyone that might be having near vision problem because the writing is fairly small :)
The package comes with everything that you need.  The mounting instructions are clear and precise so once they're adhered to, the arm serves the purpose for which it is designed.  Extremely straightforward.  Only a couple of complaints and that is the cosmetic covers the arm comes with could have been of a more durable material other than the plastic supplied. The other point is that hand tightened bolts/nuts in the assembly should be coupled with butterfly/wing nuts (or vice versa).
I have 6 of these that I bought at Target and Walmart. I use it to store all kinds of things, mostly misc. household items like paper, tape, scissors, etc.. They stack, which is good because I have a built-in bookshelf with extra-tall fixed shelves. By stacking these 2-high, I'm able to make very efficient use of the space.However, I would highly suggest buying these in stores rather than online due to pricing. Since these organizers are a large item to ship, the total price online reflects the cost of shipping. The cost in stores is usually $14 a piece or so. Online, whether shipping is listed separately or not, the total price tends to be about $10 more.
Great replacement for the one I had.  Had a dip however on top, may have been from delivery trip.  Cost was reasonable however.  Looks neat on my desk!
For its price, it is a fine storage unit.For my unit, the only complain I have is the drawers' front edges have slight gaps to frames when closed, which permits dust and pet hair to squeeze themselves inside drawers.
These drawers are fantastic for lightweight items.  I have had this product for 15 years and still recommend them.  If you store items that are heavier than, say spice jars, over time the drawers will begin to sag in the middle.  The top of the cabinet will then sag also.  Oh, don't place anything on top of the unit either since it will sag.  Don't get me wrong, the plastic is very sturdy, but will not hold up under lots of weight.If I need to place something weighty on top, I place a stiff cutting board on first that spans the width of the top.  If you are a handyman (or woman), you could cut a board the exact size and paint to match or contrast.
This is a good drawer set for the kitchen, bath or bedroom.  I use it in the kitchen for my utensiles and it works out great...the side slats hold my sandwich bag boxes and the drawers are just the right size.I would recommend it to anyone for storage problems with small items.
A great st orage Ihave this drawer set on my vanity it hold all my makeup skin And nail items .
I use this in the kitchen for storage of kitchen gadgets.
Caution: I did not buy these here, and I do not know if the only seller on this page is meaning to offer a single pen for the listed price.  These are one of Schneider's low-cost pens, the sort which one might buy by the boxful at an office store.On to the review...As a pen nut, I like this one because it resembles a small handful of European pens from roughly the 1960s (which I have seen offered in auctions without brand names).  They have a chrome ring slightly lower on the pen body than US pens from the same period, and the overall shape is more rocket-like.As a pen in general, it writes fairly smooth (above-average for a ballpoint, but not as good as a Uniball Jetstream or Papermate InkJoy) and has a good pocket clip.  I like older style pens, but I hate the crummy crimped thin sheet pocket clips they usually have (such as a Bic Clik).  The K15 has thick-yet-springy metal for the clip.I gave this 4 stars because it is a pretty decent ballpoint and I love the design.  But unless you want it for its looks, there isn't any reason to make the effort to obtain these hard-to-find pens vs. any of the slightly better common brands available at any store.  Its writing quality is more like PaperMate's Profile, but with a finer point.
Am I seeing things or what ? Is this seller really charging $19.00 for this little coin purse !??!? It looks exactly like the same one that I just bought from my local Hello Kitty Store for $4.95! It must be the same. It is a little over 4" big, and is really cute, but not $19.00 worth of cute! And this is comming from a die hard H.K. fan. (I have H.K painted on my car body). Something is wrong here as there is even a larger purse that is the same but bigger and has a raised vinyal bow plus a red strap. Is about 9" or so and even it does not cost $19.00. I love this sellers H.K. items BUT I find their lack of any product description on any of their items, really discourages me from buying. I like to know a  little information on what I am buying. AND I hate to have to keep on contacting the seller for every item I may want to purchase and have to ask them to provide more product information. What gives here? I already had to send 2 emails to the seller asking about things I want to buy from them and as any good merchant knows, the best sales are the impulse purchases. BUt their lack of any product description hinders any purchasing at all when one has to wait to hear back from the seller. Hey seller, you got some cool stuff. Tell us something about the product. A picture is NOT always worth a thousand words.
My dryer vented to the garage - what a mess.  This should help out; I can vent out the side of my house with a long pipe run (>30').  Unit is powerful, quite, and is good at shutting on/off in sync with the dryer; which is better than some competitors that will cycle 10 minutes on, 60 seconds off.The only caveat, which isn't clear in the listing,  The pressure sensing unit has to be in the vertical positions - which may limit your installation options.  I had this all laid out and ready to install for when I received the unit, but unfortunately had to re-pipe the system to work
It works very well.  The drying times are down as well as the temperature that I needed to dry the clothes.  I did have to move the dryer a little due to space in our laundry area, but it was a small issue in the overall setup.
When I moved into my new house, my family had an issue with the dryer literally leaving burn marks on the clothes.  The venting run for the dryer was between 20 and 30 feet with two 90 degree corners (one at the dryer and one at the roof vent).  I had no idea what the issue was and thought maybe the dryer was not moving enough air and the heat had nowhere to go.  Well, this fan did not fix the scorched clothes issue (turned out to be a crack in the seal around the door) but it sure made huge improvements in the performance of our dryer.If you are looking for a booster fan for your dryer, this is one of the easiest ones to install.  Many models require a moderate amount of wiring.  Many cheaper models require that you mount the fan to a joist or similar stable object, run electricity to the fan involving tapping into electric from somewhere and installing an electric box close to the fan, and finally purchasing a separate pressure switch or hard wiring the fan control to the dryer.  After all that, many fan models highly suggested installing a secondary lint trap.  Call me lazy, but to me, that sounded like too much work.Then I found the Acme Miami Dryerjet Booster.  The fan came with a pressure switch and required no secondary lint trap.  Installation was much easier.  You set the booster fan behind the dryer, plugged it in, run a new piece of dryer vent hose into the top of the fan and attach your existing hose to the side port (basically following the arrows).  The pressure switch is installed by drilling a hole into the vent pipe, inserting a sensor into the duct, taping the sensor in place, and fine-tuning the switch my adjusting a screw on the housing of the fan.  I found a roll of metal/foil duct tape (not the regular gray duck tape) to be quite handy to secure all the ductwork to the motor to prevent slippage and to tape the sensor in place.  The fan works great.  Drying times have been cut by about 25% for most loads and almost in half for big bulky loads.Overall the product works great, but there were a few things I did not like about the product:1.  The product is designed to stand up vertically.  If you want to mount the system horizontally, you have to change the pressure switch system.  It would require removing the switch from the metal fan housing and mounting it onto a wall or solid object in the same position as if it were still mounted on the booster fan.2.  As the system is meant to sit vertically when it comes from the factory, the exhaust output from the dryer has to go from the low output of the dryer to the high input on the fan.  The output of the fan comes out of the low port and out of the house.  The resulting ductwork reminds me of an interstate highway interchange, especially if the dryer duct runs up into the attic or roof.  In my opinion, there could have been some much better designs than this.  My training in Mechanical Engineering is not extensive, so it is possible I am wrong about the design, but the current design is a bit inconvenient with the ductwork.3.  Unless you mount the unit above the dryer somehow, the fan sits in the floor beside or behind the dryer.  The fan requires about 9 to 10 inches of space.  This could be an issue if space is limited in your washer/dryer area.  As I did not have 10 inches between the washer and dryer, I had to put the unit behind the dryer. So now the dryer sits a little more than 10 inches away from the wall.  A factor to consider if your laundry space is tight.4.  The pressure sensor that turns the unit on and off needs to be adjusted a few times a year.  I have been using this for about 18 months now.  As I mentioned, the pressure sensor has an adjustment screw.  I am not sure why, but about every 6 months, the booster fan will not shut off.  This requires me to pull out the screwdrivers, remove the cover, and adjust the screw.Overall, the ease of installation of this product outweighs the annoyances I have with the product.  With a piece of flexible dryer duct, a way to cut the flexible duct, some metal tape, a few screw drivers, and a way to punch through the duct (I used a drill, but what you could use depends on the type of duct), the unit can be installed by even the most unknowledgeable person in under 30 minutes.  As the unit is easily accessible, even having to adjust the sensor every 6 months is a minor annoyance.  Overall, if you have the space for this product to set on the ground, I would recommend it.
So far so good... I have a 50ft run of ventilation, and it's always been a problem for me. With this fan I have finally got enough push to dry my clothing. It's also surprisingly quite. Install instructions are a little vague, but not horrible.
The dryer vent booster has cut down drying time by 1/2 hour.  My vent outlet is very long and this has made a big difference.  It took  3 hours to install
I purchased this bag last week and it is adorable!  I have a Dell laptop and it does not completely fit in the bag but other than that the bag is just fine.  I use this bag for school and it holds my books, laptop, laptop accessories (cord & mouse) folders, umbrella and cosmetics and pens.  It is a VERY nice pink color, not too bright or dull.
This bag is beautiful.  It has LOTS of space for carrying folders, cosmetics, planners, etc.  It's great to have my cell phone handy in the outside pockets.  The padded handles make it comfortable for carrying over my shoulder.My only concern on this bag is that it's advertised as a laptop bag, but some of the conventional laptop protection is compromised for style.  While the center pocket is padded, that pocket has only an 8" zip opening.  The outside sections of the bag are lightly padded, but not as thickly as the zip pocket and other laptop carriers I've used.  The top snaps shut rather than zips, so security is something to be aware of.Otherwise, this bag is gorgeous and I still use it for my laptop, but I probably won't when flying, etc. - just going to the office with it and home.There are pockets inside for PDA, cell phone, small items and pen loops.  Very organized!  Pretty pink, too - not too bright.
I love this bag, except that it does not fit a laptop, even small ones. But I have received many compliments on it, and it fits EVERYTHING I need for class and work (other than my laptop).
I had to open the side seam to accomadate my Dell Laptop. The inside pocket seam I opened up to expand the bag and am able to  use it. I love the nice soft leather and the lovely pink color. Does not open to 6 inches wide at top of bag, but is 6 " at the bottom. I was a little dissappointed but I modified the bag to fit my computer..
I ordered this paper because it was recommended by the dealer for my Konica Minolta Bizhub 253.  They had recommended against using any of the InkJet type papers with this color laser printer.  They gave me a sample ream, which worked well - high quality color images on nice crisp paper.  I was running out of the ream they gave me, so I ordered this.  The price was reasonable, and shipping was free.It arrived quickly, with the two reams in a box.  The printed wrapping on each ream is plastic, and there was not enough to keep the reams from bouncing around in the slightly oversized box, so the plastic was a little torn on each ream (although it was largely intact), the only reason I did not rate this five stars.  However, the wrapping was largely intact, and the paper completely usable.
This was a good purchase. Although not the prettiest color, the material holding it together is extremely durable and the handle makes it so easy to transport my work. However, the way the flap closes is awkward. If you have more than a coupl of pieces, the handle just doesn't fit quite right behind the handle, making it a nuisance to adjust every few minutes. Otherwise, it gets the job done.
the other reviews on this item show that at least one reviewer has not a clue on this one!as The Etch Mate is only made for precision folding of photoetched accessories for model kits, in no way is it intended to cut or for cutting on any type of etch or plastic, now the 3c is made in a New high tech composite material made to replace the original aluminum, and having both i still like my older ally one as it will not wear like the new one if you use it a lot, and its not quie as sturdy as the old one, however if you only do a bit of folding then this will do the job well, its also well worth looking at the BUG folding tool. the new 3c has some newer FeaturesNew 3 Clamp system for additional gripping pressure.New shape upper folding head with outboard adjustable clamp knobsNew high tech composite material replaces aluminumExclusive folding channel (good idear)360-degree reversible spring-loaded folding head6  x 3  unobstructed work surfaceMolded folding blades (now you wont cut yourself !)Creates straight square foolproof folds.hope this makes it a bit clearer :)
The scrapbook is small and cute.  The design on the front is simple yet pretty.  It was smaller than what I had expected it to be...(only reason why it got 4 stars).  Otherwise, quality and feel is great.
The black fake leather on the outside is fairly cheaply glued on. But the flask as a unit works great. Good seal. And for a non-smoker I use the cigarette slot to keep money and cards at easy reach.
These are great.  The foam swap is a little more firm and abrasive than other similar products, however this makes them clean much better.  I just have to remember to be gentle as they require no pressure.  The first time I cleaned my grandsons mouth with one he was uncomfortable and I wondered why, so I tried one  on myself and realized that rubbing with pressure was irritating to my mouth.  They are great for doing quick refreshers throughout the day and keeping his mouth feeling fresh all day.  Gently wiping his lips removes any dry skin as well.  Swish often in clean water during use as it really picks everything.  I wish they had put this on the box.If you aren't  gentle they could make someone mouth sore I think.
These are hard to find especially at such good price. Good quality, how ever they seem a little discolored, appearing old and they don't smell minty at all.
Great for me it is my second box and will refill when  empty. Good product for dry mouth condition or just before brushing.
I liked the individual wrapped swab, easy to remove from the wraps. The taste was not overpowering and the stick held up to a resistant patient
Exactly what I was looking for! Able to use one daily and sometimes twice a day and then throw away
much better price than the pink ones and work just as well. Helps keep my handicapped son's mouth healthy. good buy.
Generally useful for applying sore throat medications to back of throat. Helps to reduce sore throat and sinus drainage irritation.
This product really helps with senior citizen oral hygiene. As a caregiver I find my mother can't aways handle or take the brushing of a tooth brush. These swabs are a great alternative. I would suggest the unflavored. Many senior citizens find the mint too powerful.
it is yellow, while not my favorite color it looks very appealing to look at. it gets the job done, but it is not the best yellow object i have had my hands on. it is at a awkward angle, i do not like the angle, but as i said it gets the job done. did i mention it is yellow, should have by now.
They've done studies on these hook knives, you know. Sixty percent of the time, they work every time. Be sure to wear gloves though; always wear the gloves.
Decided to spend extra for a tape dispenser and saw good reviews for this. I originally wanted the fun looking "donut" one, but read that it was very hard to open. Plus, do I really want another trigger to buy donuts every day I use this?? I am pretty happy with this dispenser so far. It has jammed once, but I didn't load the tape as well as I thought. It has been working fine since I realigned it. The only reason I took 1 star off is it was slightly tricky to load and also, it feels a little big and awkward in my hand when pulling trigger and cutting tape. Im sure I will get used to it-it's minor. I do recommend this product!
Live this tape dispenser becoming hard to find as they are no longer produced. Used caution when removing from packaging as shrink can cause trigger to break off had 2 of them do this to me as trigger is very small plastic piece. Item useless once trigger breaks.
The Xyron laminator has worked well for me.  The refill cartridges are no longer available locally; but, once again, Amazon came through.
I cant love a refill. Its better than ok..How could I not like it.Hate is a strong word, not much I hate other than Obamacare.
It is what I expected it to be. Came on time. Was glad I could find the refill I was afraid my machine might be too old.
Michael's crafts no longer carry this product.  Have to order it online. I use this at our daycare center mostly for placemats.  Most of the time it works, but sometimes it will wrinkle either the paper I'm laminating (if the paper is slightly rippled due to coloring it with paint) or the laminate itself will crease.  The later will cause water to penetrate the enclosure and ruin the placemat.  If anyone tries to crank it the wrong way (counter clockwise), it will get all out of alignment.I love it just the same as it is always ready - no heating time required, and it sticks to both sides instead of just heat sealing the edges, which can be easily taken apart.  This allows me to laminate and cut things apart without it falling apart.  Drawback is it only comes 9" wide, so everything has to fit within that dimension.
I always worry buying things that I can not touch BUT this was just perfect and to be 60 feet long it might last
Not only does this cartridge seem to fit better within the Xyron lamination machine, there is more film material contained therein. Rarely do companies give you more bang for your buck when products/accessories are redesigned.
Great for the price! I was able to use it once as I do not have a lot to laminate as of yet. Installing it was not as easy as I thought it would be as.
Easy to install, well priced and the extra footage makes it a good buy.I would recomment it to friends
A worthy investments for my business cards. It's efficient and I didn't have any problems with it sealing the cards. I am using the refill cartridge with an ezLaminator model #2001.
Where can I find support for the ezLaminator?DYMO sold a product called the "ezLaminator" for a very short time. This product was sourced from XYRON and all support is now handled by XYRON. Click here to be redirected to XYRON.
I have used this product several times and it is easy to use, you just have to be careful that it doesn't get crinkled on the bottom layer which happens occassionally but not often.Is clearly marked when you are getting near the end which is wonderful.I will use again and would recommend
This refill cartridge was very easy to install and works great.  The only potential drawback I foresee is the end of the roll.  If this is the same as the original cartridge which it appears to be, be wary.  On my original cartridge, the red "warning tab" signifying that the roll is almost empty is too close to the end of the roll, and before this tab appeared the laminate started to wrinkle and ruined a piece I was trying to laminate.
Sometimes we get bubbles in the laminated item or a page will crease. Also the seal around the edges isn't quite close enough when trimming down an item. Generally, I love the this little machine and look for reasons to use it!
I bought this laminating film to refill a laminating machine I found in storage at my preschool center.  It was very easy to load into the machine and get started with.  I have learned that I have to set my papers to be laminated all the way to the left in order for them to get completely covered.  I have also discovered that cutting this lamination gets my scissors a bit sticky.  If I have a lot of things to cut out it gets annoying, but not so much that I would stop using it.
The cartridges are easy to put in my laminator and I like using it to laminate things when I don't have access to my school's big heat laminator.  Sometimes at the beginning of the cartridge crinkles, so it's just crucial to go slowly for the first lamination on the new cartridge.  Otherwise, it's a great and convenient product.
The refill fits in the laminator and serves its intended purpose without any issues.
It is hard to find the refills for the laminator I have so it was great to find this one and the price was great too.
Did have problems when first put it in where it came out wrinkled but after the initial small bit it smoothed out and has done well since.  Very easy laminating system that looks great.
Great product.  I bought a box that did not live up to its expiration date, but chilling the ones that I do not need out works just fine.  Will order again.
Truth is, the LoL Mini-Moo's are everything they are promised.  I can't take my coffee w/o cream, that being real cream half-and-half.  That flavored liquid stuff and powered stuf just doesn't cut it... so these are the PERFECT ticket when you don't hav a place to refrigerate the store-bought stuff.  The only reason it didn't get more stars is the indicated "Shelf-life" date.  It's like 2 months after purchase.  With the UHT method and no refrige-needed, I cannot understand why this isn't more shelf-stable longer??  I plan on keeping it in a sporadically used kitchenette, an ofice setting is perfect, so I hope it lasts longer than the 2 months.  I wish Lo'L would include some printed information regarding why the short life in the package, but alas, nothing.Otherwise, good stuff!
This is the best seller I've ordered Mini-Moos from. All the others I've tried have sent already-old product, so that they went bad very quickly.  I bought the last box from this seller five months ago, have nearly used them up, and all were good.  Excellent product to have around for travel and for my away-from-the-kitchen tea corner.
So far they have been fine. Would like to purchase fewer at a time. I do keep them in the refrigerator.
amazing.  unlike the last review mine have NEVER shocked me and they keep my hands so toasty warm...mmmmmm.  great for throwing my boomerang while im smoking a cig; also nice if ur on ur computer and u like to have warm hands. the convertible thumb is more helpful then i realized it would be too.  only down side is it has a cord hanging from each glove, but easily counter it with wrappin it around the glove.  probably the best thing ive got from amazon! get if it is in stock! worth every penny!
It is a very good cosplay...but, well I did have to fix some stuff, and there was a nasty thing aobut it thye don't tell you, if you are a girl, you have to order it in MEN. Ok,? Not wemon, but MEN. It's a little big but I can fix it.Over all it is pretty good ^^
I got this as a gift form my buddy, so she could go Cosplaying with me. It was very well made, and got here very quick, but it was a little confusing on the arms and legs, but heck, it's sasuke. I really like this and if you want to Cosplay Sasuke, then here is your chance to.
Man did this come in FAST! It took 4 days to come in! WOW! The jaket itself is like a windbreaker, not cloth (I was hopeing but hey, you get what you pay for right?) but it was still very good. The ring is really nice, it's not the one I need (Doing Tobi Cosplay) but it's still nice. I really like this seller and will be ordering all/ most of my Cosplay outfits for here. (Now all they need to do is make ABSOLUTE BOYFRIEND ones then i'll really be happy. You hear that moon Costumes? Get to work!)
I just wanted a key chain flash light, it shows the hidden leaf symbol when using. Kinda like the batman light. Love it. Batteries didn't last long tho.
I have used this to an extensive degree. Inside a well sized dark basement this thing delivers! The strobe can be assorted to your liking, you can easily speed it up. I believe this model enables color filters too, great touch. I have not had any problems with the light, except for sometimes it takes a little to actually turn on. With a year of consistent use though I am pleased it has performed so well. It makes a click similar to a metronom., Haha so I use this as a two in one package Metronome and party maker! Great compact size, easily fit into any room. Obviously use in a dark room, try mixing around with a smoke/smog machine  (interesting combinations).Do note, some people are sensitive to this! Avoid long exposer to it and make sure you do not suffer from epilepsy! If you feel a little odd afterprolonged exposure it may be a placebo effect. It's always better to be safe than sorry.
Colorful poster shows chick stages. Great display and reference piece for AG classes for kids. Needs laminated surface.
works well on 5 pages or less and you do not have to take staples out before shredding!
Nice, it would be nice if it were slightly bigger.SmartPad - Black
This mask looks better in person than on the screen.  It certainly got reactions from my family members.  It is hard to see out of and breathe out of - but makes one heck of an entrance.
The only issue with this mask is you will need to make the eye holes bigger. As long as you cut with the conture of the inner eye you don't notice the difference. It is warm inside the mask so if you have something to go over your face to soak up the condensation from your breath you will be more comfortable. It is very durable and we have a great time with it and the people loved it in the Santa Parade. Great product.
Shipped fast and showed up as expected. My father was very happy to receive the gift. He has been snapping in closed with a big smile.
This item is almost perfect, but the top piece (the one you slam down to slate) is warped in the middle. Not a big deal, but not "perfect." I am very happy with this product, mostly because it doesn't say "Hollywood" or "Universal" on it, like most of these classic "black" designs tend to do. Yes, I know that now a days these boards are either Dry Erase White Boards or completely LED's, but I am a romantic and nostalgic fool. I will write on this board with chalk until it disintegrates.
this is an awesome clapboard.. should come with chalk though so you can actually write on it instead of going out and buying.. but other than that this is a good clapboard. not one of those other cheapy clapboards that are being sold here.Movieposters.com is a fast shipper. the item arrived on time and as described...
It is a nice fun gift, but do not expect heavy duty professional quality, it is what it is and exactly what I had expected. I recommend it for a gift or decoration. It is built sturdy and is wood and you can write on the "blackboard" area.
well this accesory is awsome but I really prefer it in white color, to write with black pen
This does exactly what it says it will, it arrived undamaged and works well. Most clapboards feel overpriced, but this one came a price that matches the quality. I am glad I got it.
Hello hello,Had my personal assistant find me an ashtray he thought would match my place.  I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap yet "cool" this ash tray looks.  It doesn't seem to take to water/rain well - but otherwise this thing is a great bang for your buck fashion / function device.
as good as canon oem at a lot less money/ why pay more than necessary when  you don't have to
I have never done a math fair, and this book had some very good ideas on how to run one.  I like the tips and instructions provided.
Good product but the problem is shipping charges is too high & improper instructions on the product cover.....should be more descriptive....but good deal....overall....
There are 3 depths this can punch (how close the hole is to the endof the paper)...without the gray separators, and the separators turned one way, or the other. You can also change how high or low the holes will be on the paper...you can change out the punches if they get dull, and you can move them for 2 hole punching as well.And it tears through 40 pages with no problems.highly reccomend it.
You can see what you order, there is nothing much to say about it. The only point is that the clamps are thicker than I would expect it based on the picture.
Colors vibrant, but I think it's a bit expensive. Kids love them for crafts. I would buy it again just to save time
This fine paper cut from the rarest of trees, so it can be misused by people of all kinds.five hundred sheets of out of this world paper!
I really like this paper but am not rating at five stars because of the price which seems high to me.
What can you say about copy paper? I needed some colored paper to make signs.  I like most of  the colors in this package. The  signs printed well on the paper using my ink jet printer.  My only wish is that someday companies will let us put together a pack of paper using all of the colors we like.  I rarely need a ream of one color but a package of 20 sheets of 5 different colors we choose would be great.  Until then, the colors in this pack will all be used eventually.
I love this doll.  Is anatomically correct as I expected. My daughter loves it an named it Diego as Dora's cousin.  The only thing I found dissapointing was the packaging which is kind of cheap.  But I solve it taking the doll out...
I don't know why I didn't just go to Amazon to begin with.  The are great for when you have to forward a standard letter to someone or when you have several pages that won't fit into a standard letter.  And you don't have to buy a box of 100.  Great value at the usual fast delivery I have come to expect from Amazon and associated companies.
This is a really quick way to tuck ugly cords out of sight.  I find it works better for the small power cords rather than the larger cables.  I should have (and will) order a couple more for lamps, clock radios, etc.  I like that the capture looks like a small dome and it too can be tucked out of view like the cables it holds. Great way to keep the dusting down also!  I hate the fuzzies that tend to build up around the snake nest of cables behind the furniture!  Get a couple...you will be glad. I wish the picture had more examples of its use...I would have ordered a few more!
I got these knowing that there are 2,500 of them, but wow. I won't ever need to buy toothpicks for the rest of my life. Some of them are not the best quality, but there's so many of them that it doesn't really matter.
Flat toothpicks in a pretty decently sized box.  It's as described. There were a few broken ones upon arrival, but not a huge deal since there's quite a bit of them.  I'm not going to count, looks about right.  I mainly use it for baking & making colored frosting, they seem to break or splinter off easily, so I suggest caution & a careful eye - don't leave splinters in your food.  If not for that, I would give it 5 stars. Shipping was on time.
No, each toothpick is not exactly the same size, but this is a great deal for the price, flat toothpicks are hard to find, and now I'm all set for quite awhile.
I'm a big fan of Ozium,but this Vanilla doesn't seem to mask the odors as good as the other sents,my opinion.
I bought two packs of these. Price was good even tho the S/H was IMHO excessive for such a light weight item.  I am a great fan of Ilford inkjet papers. I wish they made 13 inch wide rolls of real canvas &#34;paper&#34;
I bought this paper last year and have had great success with it.  It compares well with Ilford's Classic Pearl as well as Epson's and Lumijet's pearl offerings.  Though Ilford does not produce ICC profiles for Printasia stock (hence the lower price), there are any number of companies which will profile your paper for $30-$100+.  The weight is nice.  It has a pleasing warm color, average contrast.  If you like a high contrast paper, look elsewhere.  For my $, Premium Pearl (and Gloss) offers good color, solid tonal range and sufficient heft.
Used them for my wedding. Created my own invites and had a lot of DIY things. Made it more elegant by putting a silver shiny foiled label to seal the back. People loved them. Great buy for the money.
This pair is an awesome set to have in my bag.  It doesn't take up much space and its just there whenever I need it.  Plus the pen writes fine width and it glides across the paper.  The pencil also is a great too to have, I just need to remember to get the replacement leads.  Zebra makes a great pen and pencil, good quality and last a long time.  My first pen is a few years old and I just wanted to get a second one to keep with me in my bag.
I got this set for fitting inside my wallet and the work perfectly for that. You do have to be a little careful with them though I managed to break the pencil almost the 2nd week because it got bent in half in my wallet. The pen is still working great and its much easier to carry this than a keychain pen or just a standard pen in your pocket.
I bought this for my 4th grader.  She loved it, I loved it too since it seems to hold together better than her last one.  I will definately buy another one for her next year, but it will be a 4&#34; binder at least.
Purchased this for my youngest son.  Since i knew how durable they were from last year.  The only thing is that he was upset that it did not have the interior items like the big binder has.  I purchades him a seoerate pencil pouch.
This is decent quality. The material seems a bit cheap, but so far this has been good to me. All I carry in it really is a bunch of paper, so it's fine right now. I like the over-the-shoulder strap it has. It's very handy when you don't feel like carrying it. Thanks a lot! :)
it was great i didnt have any missing zippers this time and it is very large and it has a handle for heavy carrying and a strap
My daughter is really hard on her notebooks but this one seems to be tolerating her abuse quite well. Good product for your money.
I am using this to store nail image stamping plates in. I do think it's a little over priced, for a simple binder, but it is of very good quality. I especially like the handle and the zipper.
The rings are sturdy and the zipper pockets are convenient for holding pencils and small notes. I would recommend for a elementary and/or middle school student.
This binder is great for my music song sheet collection because it zips and carries easily. It was a little stiff at first and would not open flat on the music stand. I used a couple of large binder clips to secure it and hold it open, and now it is broken in after two weeks.
Love my new binder. I would definitely recommend  this product for students or couponers. It holds alot of pages and also has mesh pockets inside tjat could hold pens calculator etc.
This binder is lightweight, the colors are great and the shoulder strap makes it really easy to carry.  The three rings are &#34;O&#34; style, and I think a &#34;D&#34; style would work better, and they also don't hold together quite as well as I'd like (they pop open every once in a while if you turn it the wrong way by mistake.  But for the price, I think it was a good buy.
Thought I really needed this because it had the should strap, which I never used. It's made well, and sturdy, but was just too bulky to easily fit into my backpack. The color was right on, true to what I saw on the product page. Thanks!
this binder is so neat and has really soft mesh with a pocket in the front. suprisingly, the binder ring clips are good. they close really well and i think its a 2inch 3 ring binder.
Middle school aged daughter is very happy with the binder.  Does what it is designed to do.  She loves the shoulder strap so she can carry it like a messenger bag leaving her hands free for textbooks between classes.
Even though I don't see how to use the strap that it came with the binder. I don't see the useful of the strap that it came with the binder....Still it's awesome!
She did the research, picked the color, and said &#34;please get this for me&#34;. So here I am a couple months later letting you know she loves it. She uses it for organizing her shopping coupons (which in a way makes this binder pay for itself). It has pockets and zippers closed to things don't get fuddled when she is in transit.Highly recommended.
I bought this notebook for my 10 year old son and he loves it!  The only thing I would change is getting a pencil bag in it for the price.
This is the style required by my child's school.  It is huge.  Make sure they have a decent sized backpack.  But it is very functional and has held up to 3rd grade well for 3 weeks.Shipping was slow.
I purchased this item for my daughter.  Her teacher was very specific about the type of binder that she needed for class, she just was a little off on the dimensions.  My daughter had large binder similar to this one, but she also had to carry a huge 5 subject notebook to each class.  When I saw this binder it was perfect!!  The binder is both durable and flexible.  It also came with several dividers, pockets, and room to expand.  The binder had a tote handle and an adjustable shoulder strap with a comfort patch.  My daughter loved the color and the material wipes clean easily.  My daughter is now able to put the 5 subject notebook in the a pocket of this binder, zip it shut, and carry it with the handle or shoulder strap.  She consolidated so many of her books and supplies together in the pockets of this binder, that she no longer needs her bookbag.  This binder houses all of her class supplies and she totes any books in her hand.  I was very happy that I found this binder.  I will strongly recommend it to be added to the school supply list for next year's students.  It was a little pricey, but it eliminated the use of a bookbag, pencil pouch, and four folders.  This balances out.  Thanks.
This binder has really helped organize my middle school daughter.  The file is large enough to have a section for each subject's homework and the binder itself is large and works easily.  There is also a pocket for assignment notebook.  The handle on the outside makes it self sufficient...you don't have to shove it into a back pack.
My son has used Case-it Binders for four years, and they have been a wonderful organizational tool for him, keeping all papers, his assignment book and miscellaneous materials in one location. On the downside, we go through about three of these a year because: the rings in the three-ring binder break or misalign to the point that they are no longer usable; the zipper breaks on the zippered compartment, or; both problems occur at the same time. Despite those problems, we feel that the relatively low price and the overall advantages make this a very good product.
This was suggested at a Homework Seminar.  Use it with clear pocket folders for projects, add a pencil case and you're all set.  Purchased them for my 6th grader and 8th grader.  6th grader felt it was a little too bulky to fit in her desk and locker.  Be aware of size.
If you are a serious couponer usuing the baseball card method this binder will meat your need well.  I have used it for a year taking it with me every time I leave the house for any kind of shopping.  It is packed to the gills and the zipper is still holding up.  The pocket on the front is NOT full sized (8x10") it is just deep enough for most clipped coupons. When I bought mine it did come with two inserts to help keep the pages from each side seperate that are held in place with a strap of velcro.  The inserst hold 4 pens, a pad of note paper, different zipper pockets and one large enough to hold a decent calculator.  The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the zipper on the small outer pocket did break. The shoulder strap is long enough even for a tall person so when your hands are full caring in the groceries or baby you can make fewer trips.
...and I practically live off of it when I have a cold or especially when I fly on an airline, since the recycled air is loaded with viruses and other nasties.I cannot vouch for the scientific claims the manufacturer makes, but personally I can attest that these lozenges seem to shorten the span of time a cold lingers, but you have to start using them as soon as you suspect you have a cold, if you wait too long these lozenges will be ineffective.Also, this brand- and most zinc lozenges in general- can leave an odd aftertaste. Some of my family have also reported nausea when they use the lozenges on an empty stomach, so avoid that.Expense is also an issue with the Cold-Eze brand- at least in chain stores, where a bag of 18 will set you back around $8.00- ouch. So it goes without saying that if come to like this brand, shop around for deals. However, I just like Cold-Eeze because of MY experience with it. You might want to even try another cheaper brand, after all, the KEY ingredient is Zinc. I'm skeptical of any claim that the Zinc in the Cold-Eeze is better than the Zinc in some other lozenge, but there could be research out there says otherwise, I don't know.Caveats aside, give it a try, it could become a great weapon for your fight against the cold. I know it has for me.
This filter arrived on time and as agreed. The filter is exactly as claimed. I appreciate the excellent service.
My wife draws stuff and she says that these do the job when she makes a booboo.Recommended.
These pens are sweet. I love the way they write. Their only downfall is that if you use a highlighter over them the ink smears. Still like them though.
For a set of two pens, you can't beat the price; especially with prime shipping.  The pens are pretty colors and quite wide (fat).  The width may be a bit impractical, but the pens themselves are quite a novelty.
I honestly ordered these crayons because I needed to get free shipping but, eventually I gave them to give to my nieces so they could color. They seemed to enjoy them just as much as the expensive kind.
I bought this headset quite a while ago (2008-ish) and it's every bit as good as the Motorola version that sold for 3 times as much. Build quality is good. Sound quality is good and it picks up your voice quite well. I never had anyone complain they couldn't hear me or that there was too much background noise or static with it. It's a great hands-free option for the car because, once paired to your phone, you just press the large button to answer: no need to have your phone out, answer, and transfer it to the headset. Battery life is also good on it: couple days of standby power before it needs a recharge, and a day's worth of talk-time for the average person.The only reason I dinged it a star was because mine didn't come with pairing instructions and while the fit is good, it isn't exactly perfect. Pairing works the same way as the Motorola version--press the main button about 3 seconds until the ring stays lit up and then set your phone to search for discoverable devices. It took a couple attempts on my first phone, but once it paired, it would automatically re-sync any time I turned it on. Fit-wise, it's more annoying than uncomfortable. Until you get used to it, you'll probably be taking it off and putting it back on quite a bit trying to figure out the best positioning for it. Definitely fits best on people with small to average sized ears.In short:Solid performing headset at a reasonable price. As good or better than the Motorola one it emulates. Fit is comfortable enough, and ear-hook is reversible.
Nice calendar with many typical photos.  I needed a Yorkie calendar, this seller offered a very nice one, and it arrived as promised...QUICKLY!  Deeply appreciated transaction.
My son lusted after these pens at a brick and mortar store, but they were way too pricey for his budget.  He got a great deal here.  He draws manga art and loves using these markers to ink his drawings.  My son especially appreciates the skin tones, which are hard to find in other markers sets.  So far, the markers have been durable, and I've not heard any complaints.
I bought this for my daughter.  The picture of the product on line made me believe that the kit was much bigger than it was.  Was a little misleading.
So this is a great eye catcher and says "hey I have $300 to blow on a highlighter" but the refills cost a little much for only lasting a minimal amount of time. Great product though!
Good product overall.  I've been using it to take my lunch back and forth to work for several weeks now.  It is not a sturdy as I thought it would be.  You have to be careful not to bend the hinges when opening and closing the box.  The finish is high quality, the colors are bold and the paint seems durable.
I received the item promptly and had no trouble! Seeing as though it was a gift, I just wished the box itself could have been in better shape but the product wasn't damaged at all. Thank you so much!
What can I say other than it is a decent eraser for the price. I admittedly don't use it for the originally intended use, instead using it to wipe dew from my car windows in the early morning hours (after learning that erasers are a little more absorbent than hand towels for that sort of thing).
Lightweight, Lightduty, Economy Chalkboard Eraser.  Adequate.  If you are wanting a nice, sturdy, heavy duty eraser, spend a few extra dollars on something nicer than this one.
It does the job! Use it with a very old blackboard and it wipes clean. Very functional. Eraser is easy to clean.
It is a good product for a great price. Does the job, perfect for a child. My daughter uses it with her little chalkboard.
I got this eraser for a very low price through Amazon's add-on item program. It's a decent eraser for the price. The quality isn't the best but you do get what you pay for. I only use it once per week so it will last me a long time but if you're going to use it more often, you should probably spend more for a better quality eraser.
Just what I was looking for. These were the covers for our wedding programs. I couldn't give 5 stars because I had trouble with them jamming the laser printer in my office and shipping was slow. They printed fine in my ink jet at home.
I bought these programs to use for my wedding and am pleased with the quality.  The paper is pretty heavy and the pearl border looks nice.  I would definitely recommend them to someone who wants to make wedding programs at home, but would offer two tips:1. I downloaded the template provided and it worked well but I found the columns needed some tweaking.  They were slightly off center when I did a test run print on regular paper so I adjusted them slightly and it came out great.2. When printing the outside, my printer would slip when feeding in the paper.  About 20% of mine slipped while printing and ended up printing off center.  Lucky for me I ordered a LOT of extra.  (I ordered 3 packs of 50 and only ended up needing 95) so I was fine to just throw away the ones that slipped.  My printer is pretty new and good quality but I'm sure no two printers are alike and everyone's luck with the printing might be different.Bottom line, I definitely recommend these but wanted to provide some advice for future brides who might consider using these!  They are really great for the price, especially considering they cost a fraction of having your stationer print programs that match your invitations.
Great product.  Would have given it 5 stars if 9 pieces came in the set so that you could creat a 3x3 square configuration.
The seller did a fine job. It arrived on time.  These books have a smooth binding rather than the canvas/cloth mesh binding.  The seller claimed the books had the cloth cover and showed a picture of some that do.  The books I was sent do not have a cloth cover.  That's a personal preference as the smooth bindings tend to tear up faster through normal use.  That said, the books are in mint condition.  Otherwise the books are as described inside with the ruled note pages - one must be careful not to get the ledger style which is lined differently.  Sometimes the Gov Printing press screws up and binds the pages lined upside down; fortunately that was not the case with this batch. Now if they could just bring the price down a bit.
If anybody had to pull duty in barracks, at sea, wherever ...You know this is a cool logbook, a reliable item, and rather inspiring to an old salt anyway.I will use one for budget, one for my Great American Novel notes, and one for mileage maybe.I gave a couple out to vet friends and family-- because they dig that memory lane trip too perhaps a jot.And I will likely get more when I run out.I am very happy they still make them and sell them.Thanks Amazon. Semper Fi.
I was introduced to these notebooks during my first tour of duty in Iraq.  They are a great, no frills way to track operations.  NOTE: there is another version of this notebook in 5.5x8 inch size that is slightly different with two columns marked off to track dates or itemized lists.Suggestion: buy some Post It adhesive tabs to mark off items or months and get a notebook cover. This is a great way to quickly retrieve data when your computer is down or not available. The notebook covers are sold by various military surplus dealers like Blackhawk or Raine.  Now you can personalize your notebook , often with velcro name tapes and hold loose items in the pockets.
I have been interested in ball point pens and mechanical pencils ever since I was but a we lad. There has always been something about a quality pen or pencil that fascinated me. Modern mechanical pencils use metric measurements for the size of the lead with 5mm, 7mm, or 9mm being the most common. Back in the day lead diameter was measured in inches with 0.036 (9mm) and 0.046 inches which was about 1.15 mm being the only two sizes that I am aware of. Many of the old mechanical pencils came with the 0.046 inch lead but nowadays its all but impossible to find that size lead unless you order it over the internet. As a matter of fact the Retro 51 line of pencils is the only mechanical pencil that I'm aware of that takes the &#34;fat&#34; lead. The reason I like the fat lead pencils is because it doesnt break nearly as easily as the narrower diameter leads so I can use my Retro 51 for marking wood or whatever I need to measure before cutting without the agravation of the lead breaking off. Not to say the lead won't break but it takes significantly more pressure before it does. I had another one of these pencils but I lost it at work so I ordered another one. If it had a cap over the eraser I would have given it a five star rating but that just reflects on the styling and not the function.
i bought this last year and i love it but the size was HUGE i think i might use it this halloween not sure
I purchased this for my 2.5 year old daughter who LOVES fairy princess stuff. It's beautifully made but slightly fragile in that the wand has sequins that are wrapped around a plastic tube and become detached easily when played with. I think this would have been better suited for an older child but it was easily fixed with a little duct tape! My daughter loves it!
No sei se foi devido ao transporte, mas a lata veio com um leve amassado.Apesar disso, excelente material. Era o que eu esperava.
I have used this pen for the past two years. In response to an earlier post, I have an answer.The stylus is used for entering data into a PDA. I have an iPAQ 2415 and this is the all in one best feature for me.I love the way the pen writes in all conditions and on all surfaces.By having the stylus option, I never have to hunt down another input device for my PDA. The beauty of the stylus is that you can use a full size pen as opposed to the small stylus that comes with your device.Another advantage is with the mechanical pencil, you always have just what you need to do a crossword puzzle.The only reason I did not give this great pen 5 stars is that if you write a great deal, you will find that the ink runs out sooner than you might like. The cartridge is smaller than usual due to space limitations to get so many wonderful features into such a small space.Best work around I found..........if you buy the pen, order some extra refills for whatever color you will use the most!Excellent product, works flawlessly unlike some other multi purpose pens I have wasted money on, and does exactly what it claims it will do without any hassle.
I say tool as this pen is more than a writing instrument, it is a tool for a creative few who look to transcend the norm and flaunt brains over good looks!  as this pen is not sleek and nimble as much as being so functional.  I love the Space Pen! the silver bullet is small and sleek, but the QUAD gives you 2 colors of ink that write on c\GLASS CERAMIC, STAINLESS STEEL, UPSIDE DOWN on wet surfaces... like a sharpie that writes on anything! Plus you got a pencil too!  the stylus?  why the stylus?  i don't get the stylus :(  why not a blue pen or highlighter?RP.
I was looking for something to use for business cards, and not a typical case.  This is adequate for that purpose though it doesn't hold a lot.  I'm a fan of the artist and am glad that I have it.  I also like the fact that I can use it for other uses as well...it's great, appears to be of good quality and was a good value overall for the money.
I like that it functions as a dry erase board in addition to flip chart.  It isn't completely easy to carry, doesn't lock into the short position unless I'm doing something wrong, but it's not the most difficult to carry either!  I recommend it.
The product arrived the next day and was exactly what we were expecting! The package was a little damaged but the board was fine. We are happy with it and it is already in use.
have downsized to an apartment, and this set is very space saving.  Only problem is the tape dispenser, which doesn't do a good job of cutting the tape. Teeth on it also catch on your fingers, so be careful. The magnets are STRONG, and hold great.I didn't have a place to put the docking strip so used a metal lid to hold everythng except the paper clip dispenser.  It has the magnets on the back and is deep enough for pens and pensils, so, I use it freestanding.Little expensive, but if you are looking for small, this is the set for you.  I would buy it again.
I was pretty impressed with this pen, it's definitely a good fountain pen for the price.  It's mostly made of plastic that seems pretty cheap, but as long as you aren't using it as a crow-bar it's sturdy enough.  The reason why I gave it a four and not a five is because it writes a bit wet.  That's not a huge problem, but you end up using a lot more ink than you need to.  Furthermore, I used it with the Z24 converter, and I can only fill it about halfway or else it will start leaking and dripping.  Overall, It's a great pen for the price and works great, it's just too runny to hold a lot of ink.
I ordered the black fine point fountain pen, but I received a blue fine point fountain pen. The pen itself was very great quality for the price, despite being the wrong color. I would rate this 5/5 had I gotten the color I ordered!I would definitely recommend this pen!
I love the design of this pen.  It is simple and sturdy, and writes very smoothly.  Small problem: I keep it in my pencil case, which I usually throw in my backpack.  Sometimes I notice a little ink has leaked out, probably from all the motion.  This ink stays in the cap, and can easily be wiped off with a tissue, but still, it leaks.  Then again this is my first ever fountain pen, so I perhaps I am supposed to expect leaks unless I keep it stationary on my desk.  Even without the leaking it goes through ink pretty fast, so make sure to order some refill cartridges.  Overall the design outweighs the ink issue, for me at least.
I have always wanted to try fountain pens. I like it; it's a good standard pen. It can get a little messy sometimes but I really like it and have had it for almost a year now
I am begin to experiment with writing with fountain pens and had read about the performance of this company's product. I decided to try it and find it is a nice instrument. I haven't had to fill it or change the cartridge since my purchase, nonetheless it has worked well and I am keeping it from my spouse who will probably lose it.
its a very nice pen, the fine nib is a little scratchy and sometimes skips when i start to write with it
This pen is cool, I am really happy to buy it, it added depth and more flexibility to my work! thanks!
These pens are really good value. The grip is comfortable and the ink flows well from the nib. The main downside is that they feel a little light, lacking some of the heft of other pens, but for the price, they are hard to beat.
Better quality than expected given the other reviews. Didn't see any sign of a label or marking being removed. A little thinner than I expected but good.
the product was as described and priced reasonably, it surves its purpose. made out of vinyl or plastic. so i was sastified
I bought this pad holder for my car.  I used it to keep my checkbook, reciepts, pad of paper, etc. It was the perfect size and the zipper keeps everything from falling out.  It slips between the passenger seat and the console.
Product was exactly as represented. It satisfied the requirements I was looking for. For the money, it is quite well constructed and has more features than I expected.
I like the holder for, carrying around my coupons, and my chores to haveto get done. As a reminder.
Love the looks and feel of real leather, works very well for taking some notes and where space is limited.
Great for carry around from meeting to meeting, small but still a great little folder. Not bluky and carries everything you need
They are square, and they're consistent, but not 1&#34;.  Not even 25mm as I first suspected.  QC could be a lot better.  Having said that, I can adjust and for making patterns for prototypes I can manage to work it out.
The product arrived in perfect conditon.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating because I was looking for a roll of 1/2 or 1/4 inch grid, but couldn't find it so I had to settle for this product instead.
I am a priest, and frequently people stop me after Mass to ask me to visit someone in the hospital or who is sick at home.  Unfortunately, my memory is not the best, so I need to write things down.  I realized that it would best to carry a small notebook in my back pocket instead of searching for a piece of paper and pen.  This is a bit bigger than I expected it to be, but it still fits in the back pocket of my pants.  I can keep my business cards in it, and the note pad looks to be the size that will be easy to find a refill.  I do not use the pen sleeve; I fear it would make it too wide for some pockets, but I have a neat pen from Staples which I can clip in the top fold.  The leather seems to be of excellent quality.
I bought this for my daughter as a christmas present. She loves it. They shipped it in time but the post office messed up and we didn't get it untill after christmas.
I got this art set when I was about 12 (and that was several years ago).  It includes oil pastels, drawing pencils, water colors, colored pencils and markers all in the same colors.  The colors are smartly separated by tonality (earthy, primary, pastel), and was rather helpful in deciding which colors went together best...The general quality of all the items was good, although I wish that the colored pencils worked a little better.  They didn't seem to lay down the color as well as a Crayola colored pencil might.This is a good kit for the beginning artist (especially kids and young adults), and I would recommend it.
the recipient of this gift was very pleased.  she is a creative young lady and loves to draw and was excited with all the possiblilites.  I was impressed with the fact that I ordered it a few days before xmas and received it in time.
The items stowage compartments need to be glued to the case better. But I really like.... my kid too... the product. Just add more glue so I dont have paste the compartments back in...
Often times at work I find myself struggling to get through the day.  The coffee's always weak.  Either somebody comes in way too early in the morning and waters it down or corporate is reusing grounds.  This offense is nothing, I suppose, when compared to the off brand condiments they put in the break room: "Splend-o, the other sugar substitute," and "Coffee mite!"Truly, I often find it difficult to shift into fourth gear and really be productive.  Of course, that was before my wife and I celebrated our eleventh wedding anniversary last spring.  True to tradition, we exchanged steel presents.  I gave her a stainless steel picture frame with a black and white picture of our wedding day.  She gave me the ability to kick into gear without blowing the papers clear off my desk.That's right!  Don't ask me how she found it but she gave me the Auto Art Lamborghini Gearshift Paper Weight.  All stainless steel.  Laser precision etching and the size ratio is 1:1.  If you walk by my office you may think I'm in a conference call with Tulsa but man, you could not be more wrong.  Usually during the Tulsa meetings I'm on the Autobahn, really putting my 2004 Cherry L-Shaped desk through its paces.  I can fly past accounting, buzz HR, and almost break the sound barrier by the time I get down to logistics.  All this action, without ever displacing a single paper.  Of course I do only have the one paper weight... And I do only use it for the outgoing pile... The incoming pile usually ends scattered along the Austrian and German border during the Tulsa meetings.  So really, this paper weight is the gift that keeps on giving.Contributed by: S. Polsdofer
I expected this thing to pop open and shut like those popper things you find in the 50 cent bubble toy machines at supermarkets.  The material is actually very soft, and doesn't really pop open or closed, you just kinda push it open as much as you want to get your cord in and then push it closed.  I mostly just use this for my Sony MDR-V150 headphones to shorten the 10ft cord to a more manageable length.  The top and bottom have a little semi-circle cutout for the cord but the halves tend to rotate around and I find my cord just sticking out from anywhere.  Works pretty well but I'd make it a little stiffer and cheaper, closer to $5, if I could.
I do not attend enough to keep on top of procedures.  This helps me have what I need. This and the training manual reminds me  of what my mind does not remember.
This contains the forms used by CERT and will be a welcome addition to my cert gear. I hope it never has to be used.
This is a great addition to my Midori, it's just a little expensive. I think I will make my own next time.
The paper quality is excellent. Very little bleed through from my Lamy All Star Fountain Pen; really only where I've used a bit too much ink. Very pleased with the quality.
The suction cups help it stay put on a flat surface. It jams every once in a while but, they all do in my experience. I usually used it for 5 pages or less at my desk. Had it 2 years so far and it's still working fine. Was well worth the money!
It' nice and durable, I'd prefer that they make these in more colors and at least for this item, HAVE A SIMPILER NAME LISTING!!!
This product really works on stainless steel.  It leaves a nice shine and water spots seem to wipe off more easily.  The smell is quite strong but it dissipates quickly.
I purchased this product based upon reviews which suggested that this product cleans and shines.  It is marginal to ineffective at cleaning stainless steel; however, it is excellent for protecting and shining stainless steel.Here's the 411:  If your stainless steel appliances are dirty, clean them thoroughly first with a solution of baking soda and water.  Scrub, scrub, scrub and only WITH the grain of the steel.  DO NOT USE A 3M GREEN PAD - it will scratch.  Use a sponge and baking soda.If there are scratches from everyday use on your appliances, this is your opportunity to eradicate them. Use very fine sandpaper (300 to 800) to sand the scratches out by hand, using your finger and a small bit of sandpaper.  Don't panic if your hand slips and you make a mistake and go against the grain, just sand AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GRAIN and your scratches should disappear.  Wipe the micro shavings/dust clean with a soft microfiber cloth.  Do not attempt this step on stainless steel which does not have a directional pattern as you will simply make a mess of your finishes.Then, when you have cleaned your appliances and they are as clean as you can get them, you should apply Sheila Shine on a soft, lint free cloth.Here's what the Sheila Shine does, IMHO:  it shines your clean appliances and puts an imperceptible oil-like clear coating over the clean stainless.  Why would you want such a finish?  Because, next time you have splatters, smudges, etc., you can wipe down your stainless with a clean microfiber cloth, moistened if necessary, and the usual kitchen splatter will easily slide off.It is important that I direct your attention to the fact that this product smells like lacquer thinner or gasoline and you wouldn't want to use this just prior to having guests.  Choose a day when your cleaning daemon wakes you with a mission to compulsively clean and you have no one coming over for at least two days to perform this task.  Then, later, when your guests do arrive, they will marvel at your blazingly bright, seemingly new stainless steel appliances!
Product has a lot of petroleum distillates in it [light oils] and has a very strong odor.  Open all the windows when using. Application is by a &#34;cloth&#34;.  Suggest paper towels, as you will want to toss these out after using; due to odor issues.  Last point is packaging is a bit difficult to get can open.
Although the product really helped on the stainless steel door to the refrigerator, the smell was overwhelming.  Smelled like turpentine.  For someone with allergies, including chemical sensitivities, I was very disappointed.
There is nothing less attractive than dirty stainless steel.  and nothing harder to polish.  This stuff is great--- cleans, shines and provides a protective seal to top it off.
The product is great but one of the cans had been opened and a little of the contents was in the packing John Clark
Like the title says, they are just simply a perfect pair of hoop earrings.  Simple, sturdy, and they don't tarnish.
This has to be the prettiest wallet I've ever seen that comes as part of a set. It's black on the outside, but pink multi-colored on the inside. It's got plenty of pockets, and card slots. My only complaint, is that it doesn't fit back into the pocket on the organizer very well, after you stuff it full of things. You don't have to though. It's actually quite neat..it's set up so that you can snap it together and leave it as a seperate wallet, or you can change where you snap it, and slide it back in to the pocket on the organizer and snap it into place there. I'm just so happy with it! You wouldn't believe how many pockets, and zippered pockets are in this thing. The organizer is nice too. Very handy with lots of extras that you don't find very often. Deffinately worth the money!
Bought this as a Secret Santa gift. I was actually surprised at the quality of this item. It is quite heavy and the material is good. The whole idea is pretty neat and I would have liked one for myself.
This is the first time we have tried these bags.  However, we have ordered from this company before.Their last version of a &#34;bio bag&#34; was a completely different bag, it seemed it had some amount of petroleum in it so it wasnaturally stronger.  Since we live in Florida, I'd ordered 18-24 months worth and kept them in a dark pantry.I called the company in Canada before ordering again these since I was confused about the name change.I was told this bag is their new and improved bag, (within last 18 months or so) has zero petroleum, 100% biodegradeable and held to a higher standard, it also totally bio-degrades within 10-45 days.Because it doesn't have any petroleum it will never be as strong as the bags in the supermarket.Over the years we have tried every bio/eco bag we could find on the market, every one of them broke more than once on the way from the kitchen to the garage.  Since hubby was cleaning it up most of the time, it's been hard to convince him this was worth the effort.So finally, a bag that's working so far and rates the highest.Just in case though, we carry the garbage can with the bag in it to the garage!
My husband and I have been using these bags for over a year.  At times they come in different dimensions (for example, sometimes they are wider and therefore don't fit our can liner as well).  They also don't hold a lot of weight - most of our trash is from the cat litter boxes, and we have a lot of cats.  We have to change the bag when it is about 2/3 full, but that's no big deal because with aforementioned cat litter in the bag we don't like to leave it sitting around too long.  They do a good job, and I feel better not putting a bunch more plastic in landfills.
Our city garbage collector asks us to separate compostable materials (mainly food waste) from other waste but we can't just dump it in the trash bin - it has to be bagged somehow.  We discovered these bags and have found them very useful for disposing of compostables.  They are quite big so we only need to use about 2 bags a week (sometimes only 1 bag a week if the waste doesn't start to stink).  The bags are a bit flimsy and seemingly fragile, but they will stay in place in the kitchen garbage can and we've never had one tear.  Since we can't put ties on them, we have to knot them at the top when we dump them but that's a minor issue.  If you need a compostable bag, this one will work for you.
I just like the fact that I'm throwing less in the trash, and benefiting our community garden's compost project at the same time. They can get weak or develop holes if you put things in that are wet, but overall they're nicely made, tough, dependable bags.
